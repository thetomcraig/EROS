<div id="127469" class="received"><div class="time">17:48:43</div><div class="text">But I'd hate to visit my parents and, like, their landlord. Or their *shared walls*. Or their *bundled utilities!*</div></div>
<div id="127470" class="received"><div class="time">17:48:44</div><div class="text">Gross. </div></div>
<div id="127476" class="received"><div class="time">17:50:21</div><div class="text">Actually had this convo with Lesley the other day. Seems like people from some parts of the country are ok with condos/appts, others not. It's a regional thing. Midwesterners are firmly house people, east coast are appt/condo. Seems like a question of available space. </div></div>
<div id="127478" class="received"><div class="time">17:51:09</div><div class="text">Tom and I are pro-house bc we grew up I. The suburbs in a big house, plus CA is a pro house area</div></div>

<div id="127488" class="received"><div class="time">17:58:03</div><div class="text">Here's something I made today. Designated the holotype for a species description I'm working on</div></div>
<div id="127489" class="received"><div class="time">17:58:11</div><div class="text">Then took a photo for the paper. </div></div>
<div id="127490" class="received"><div class="time">17:59:25</div><div class="text">Trick is, he's all floppy, so I couldn't get him to lay flat without manhandling him. What I did was press him flat with my hands, then take several photos with hands in different spots. Then I put them all together in Photoshop. Ends up with a way better photo than you usually get in these papers</div></div>
<div id="127491" class="received"><div class="time">18:00:33</div><div class="text">Plus since I can blend / color match like a mofo, it's pretty much impossible to tell its a composite. Esp if it's printed in BW. </div></div>

<div id="127507" class="received"><div class="time">18:12:19</div><div class="text">It was pretty big and planety. Neat!</div></div>
<div id="127510" class="received"><div class="time">18:13:03</div><div class="text">That's the idea. I also just upgraded out of appt/condo life, and I can't imagine going back. </div></div>
<div id="127512" class="received"><div class="time">18:13:51</div><div class="text">Well obviously. </div></div>
<div id="127514" class="received"><div class="time">18:14:54</div><div class="text">That's true. It's a big city </div></div>
<div id="127516" class="received"><div class="time">18:15:16</div><div class="text">But also surprisingly small in some respects. Like in terms of nice places to spend time. </div></div>
<div id="127517" class="received"><div class="time">18:15:30</div><div class="text">Real concern is, how badly do you want to move again?!</div></div>
<div id="127519" class="received"><div class="time">18:19:17</div><div class="text">So is the gentrification stalking out, or has it not started?  Or are prices good because it's just starting now?</div></div>
<div id="127522" class="received"><div class="time">18:23:06</div><div class="text">Fair enough. Still feels weird to buy a condo.  And I can guarantee your neighbors on a orange Grove will be senior old republicans with horses, not young tv/movie people with babies. </div></div>

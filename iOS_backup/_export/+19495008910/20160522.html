The people I work with - as usual - are completely clueless to things that aren’t related to TV/SciFi/comics.

<div id="127339" class="received"><div class="time">19:41:55</div><div class="text">But the average old fucker complaining about something to the paper - wouldn’t they just have word on their PC and use that?</div></div>

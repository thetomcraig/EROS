	<string>Interesting day. 
I got a lot of good sleep last night, so I felt well rested, but my stomach hurt all day. Did very well ok one midterm and very poorly on another. Overall pretty average I guess. 

Writing in here so that I can try to focus on the positive. Sidney just did that thing she does all the time, act like she is upset about something and imply that I did something wrong, and then we say good night a dim left with my dick in my hand feeling like a dick and not understanding why. 
But a lot of times it isn't important so I'm trying to ignore it. 

Not sure about the coming quarters, I've been fucked by the system again and might not get a class I need. All in all this school has done me a great many disservices. There are a lot of good things too like too, but I am not overwhelmed by them. 

But I am grateful that I was able to go home last weekend and I am grateful that my parents are here for me. I am grateful for the friends I have the ones I have been making. I am grateful for the professors who do respect me and those who I appreciate. I am grateful that I have been able to learn the subject I really love and I have a bit of time this quarter to work on some of my projects. 

I miss summer. School just burns me out I think. Lately the days have been seeming so short. Maybe because I don't have a whole lot to do in them.  While taking three classes has lightened my load a bit it has made the days seem shorter. This quarter totally flew by. Week 7 is almost over and I feel like it has just begun. 

I miss some things about high school too.  The ability to have my own space and to see friends too and have instant access to them. The shreds of free time I had which are now just slivers. My family and my house. 

The house thing is sad too.  I guess I never felt like it was a goodbye. I don't know.  

I'm annoyed that Sidney puts me in these moods. Whether she means too or not.  I think I get emotional twice as often because we are together so much. Not that it's a big problem though. But I miss my friends too freshmen year. 

Anyway I'm a little  dad about it, but I am trying to focus on the positive. I'm looking forward to the end of the quarter. And I'm grateful for what I have. </string>

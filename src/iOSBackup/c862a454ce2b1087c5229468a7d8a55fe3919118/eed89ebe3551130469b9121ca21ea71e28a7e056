	<string>I planned to eat 10:30, with or without people.  But I ran into Hin and asked me to eat with her and her friends.  I figured I might as well, I always see her friends around anyway.  Sid came later and sat with us to, but not near me.  I talked to some other friends, Amy and a girl named Sloan.  They seemed alright, but the conversation was a bit forced I felt.  Regardless, I'm going to shit out my paper now.</string>

	<string>About to go to El Coyote.  Job at JPL is okay, though it is kind of slow right now.  My boss come back to town on Monday so I think I can finally start actually working when he gets in.  Just been teaching myself the language I have to know - IDL.  Its kind of cool because there are four other students my age who I work with basically doing the same thing.  And I get $3000 in a few days!  I feel like I am kind of getting back into things here, watching TV and playing video games and the like.  Going to see Luke on Sunday.  Alfred is leavening town which is a bummer.  Working on the n64 computer, finished the Pi hardware although the emulator was hanky, don't really care because I will portably use it for a little server anyway.  

Dad just came back from NYC, where he is probably going to be offered at a job at NYU, and the pro sect of moving there has suddenly materialized.  And I still don't know about Vanderbilt of course, so for all I know I will be going there and my parents to NYC is a few months.  I mean I think we should move, but not to the other side of the country!  I kind of wanted to have this place to come back to if I went to Tennessee; it won't be that comforting to have to go "home" to NYC and have it be different as well.  

I miss Sidney, predictably, and I am scared that I will never see her or anyone at UCSB ever again.  But I am trying not to think about this because for all I know i won't even get into Vanderbilt.  Part of me wants tis to happen because the change is so scary.</string>

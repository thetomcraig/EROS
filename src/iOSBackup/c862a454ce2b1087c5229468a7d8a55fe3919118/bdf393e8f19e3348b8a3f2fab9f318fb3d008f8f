	<string>I had to ask Sidney to leave, to study alone.  She was flustered, and I know it was just because she is worried about the test but she was short with me, and it put me on edge.  I know it will be better in the morning though, its really not that big a deal.

I can't stop thinking about Katya.  I have no idea why, I just can't get her out of my head.  I keep thinking about when I drove to her house, when we spent time together, when we made love.  I guess It's just difficult for me to juxtapose these two relationships in my head.  Katy and Sidney are so very different, but I feel the same way about Sidney that I did about Katya.  And maybe its because Sidney doesn't want to have sex (yet?) that makes it difficult.  I have to buckle down - math final tomorrow.  But I can't get Katya out of my head - I really don't know why.</string>

	<string>Pink eye almost gone, first final in about half an hour.  Nervous because I didn't study, and didn't need to.  Memorized the hamlet speech and that was all i really had to do.  Gah! I know ill be fine but that confidence makes me kind of nervous.  Anyway, I'm almost done with the quarter.  This test today, math and history tomorrow.  History is pass/no pass so I probably won't even study for it.  Ready to be home!!</string>

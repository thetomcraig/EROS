	<string>Last weekend was pretty shitty. I spent the whole weekend writing an English paper and studying for a CS final, three weeks before any other final.  I didn't realize until yesterday that this is week 9, not 8.  That means I only have two weeks of instruction left, including this one.  Then Im done with this quarter at least, but I still wish i had more time.  Winter quarter always feels like the shortest.  We have to demonstrate our project for CS48 on Monday.  Meaning we have to have a lot more done than we do now.  Houjie and Chang still have contributed nothing.  So this weekend will suck too, and I know the one after sill suck hard.  So I guess it's just work hard until the end of the quarter.  This shit sucks.  I really don't know if next quarter will be better either.  

At least I got all my applications done, so now I just have to be nervous about transfers and SURF.  Awesome, flipping awesome.</string>

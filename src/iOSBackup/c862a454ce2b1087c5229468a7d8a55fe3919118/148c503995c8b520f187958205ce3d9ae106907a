	<string>First week almost done. I don't hate any of my classes yet so that's good. I also haven't been swamped with work so. Hats also good. Got all my JPL paperwork done and I know all my colleges received all the papers.

Went to talk to Conrad today about my CCS possible admission. He said they decided "maybe."  Meaning they want more proof that I'm an upstanding gentleman who pursues education and maybe I can work on my project and show some of it off. Also that I might be interested in a CCS computer science course on cloud computing. I said yes but I'm taking four classes. He said I could take it for a few units and I said its hard enough trying to manage my projects with 4 classes. He emailed the teacher (guy named Murat) and the current plan is to drop philosophy and take this class instead if he is willing to give me an add code. So I'd be taking three computer science classes and a stats class. But this class could essentially be me working on my project and getting units for it. And then show some of it off to the CCS people and then I can know if I got in before I hear back from my colleges. I'll hear back from them mid April - may. So pretty soon. Hopefully I will soon come to a conclusion based to the issue I started struggling with at the start of this journal. 

Waiting to go talk to a guy named Jeremy Roark about a Perfectionist group (group therapy). At Santa Catalina. Very nice over here, only the second time I've been here. 

Sidney being kind of weird. Not to me specifically, so were still good. I missed her over the break. She's only taking 12 units and trying to find a fourth class, and worried about that level of shit. 

So hopefully I can get into this CCS class and subsequently CCS. Still waiting on colleges!</string>

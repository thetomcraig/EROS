	<string>Computer Pile. 
Slept in today, had Rylan over, went in to work around 12.  
Got some new stuff in the mail, which I actually like. 
Finding it easy to work on comp sci projects when I am very interested in them!

Got the wood piece from rylans dad, and it looks great. 
This is for computer pile 2, which used to be the n64. 
Rylan is taking computer pile - out minecraft server - to school with him. 
Sad to see it go, but well play on it of course. Just part of moving I guess. 

Talked to Sidney for a few minutes in the phone, UC horror stories, will elaborate later. 

Off to bed.</string>

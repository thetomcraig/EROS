	<string>Another boring day and still no news from Vanderbilt.  I can't believe I haven't even resolved the problem I was struggling with when I started this journal. 

Worried about Sidney. If I stay here I'm going to have to awkwardly break up with her, because I am not going to continue the relationship next year. 

I'm just so worried I won't get bro vanderbilt. And I will feel trapped and unworthy. I'm tired of it here.  Honestly I just hate school so much. College is no exception. At least the quarter is almost over -week 8- but I wish it were over now.

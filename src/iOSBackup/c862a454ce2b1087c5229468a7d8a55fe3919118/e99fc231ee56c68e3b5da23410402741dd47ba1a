	<string>Pretty good day, first of the quarter.  Setup, or started, the n64 as a file server.  Classes were pretty good.  Math teacher not too bad.  Adrian in the class :( but it should be fine.  Think I'll be in a group without him in 48 and won't work with him in 56.  I feel he is distancing himself from me as much as I from him.  This is good though, but we'll see.  

Anyway, the day was good.  Everything becoming familiar again I guess.  Nate is in my math class, which is cool because he seems like a chill dude.  Python mechanize script being lame, as usual.  I don't know why its so finicky.  Looking forward to my classes actually, so maybe this quarter won't be shit.  I'm in the wait and see phase.  Not much else to say.

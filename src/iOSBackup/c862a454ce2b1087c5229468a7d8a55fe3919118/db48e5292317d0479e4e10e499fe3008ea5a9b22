	<string>Okay I have a bit more time to write this time - I swear.  Maybe not...  But I going to anyway because its important.  I feel very different overall and I think this is a combination of non-stressful classes and changed emotional state.  

I have been feeling very different ever since I got back to school, and while it was very apparent and sever a few weeks ago, it has leveled out to a certain extent.  Overall I feel less anxious about a lot of things.  I think I have been able to get over the perfectionism issues I have been struggling with.  I think a large part of this positive change is what Mark Baker talked about - the increase in how seriously I take my emotional relationships.  By making more friends and prioritizing time with friends over other concerns, I have been able to be more happy.  

Maybe more happy is not the right phrase to use.  Really, I feel less anxious and nervous.  Which is good.  Its great really; I never felt like I could feel differently about certain things (school, projects, myself) and I do feel better about them now.  At the risk of sounding clich√©, I feel like a weight has been lifted; I used to have this anxiety that controlled me and it has been eradicated.  Of course it is still there though, but not in the same way.  It's like I used to experience everything through this anxious lens, which caused truly anxious events to be magnified, and everything else to be lessened and made to seem less than substantial.

But now I feel like that has been ripped away and I don't know what to do with what's underneath.  Because it's not as if my problems are totally gone, and I really am having the same emotions as before, just less severely.  So they're still there, and I still feel the same way about them.  I still worry about getting my work done and finishing my projects and getting enough exercise.  It feels like everything has been dialed down.  Because of this I don't feel the same way about used to bring me satisfaction.  I ad hoped that what happened was a lessening in severity of troublesome things like anxiety.  But while that has happened, everything else has been dialed down too.  In fact EVERYTHING has been dialed down.  My happy, sad, anxious, angry, triggers all elicit emotions that seem to pale in comparison to the ones I felt last school year (and even over the summer).  

I mean, this is good, and it's a step forward, but it's not perfect (heh).  I feel kind of annoyed because I see everything happening to me that always happens, but it does not consume me like it used to.  Of course this is better than the alternative; I used to feel like I was been consumed by my own anxiety and slowly killing myself and breaking down.  I used to worry that I would just snap one day.  Not that I know what that means.  Not suicide, but something not so pleasant.  Like yelling at someone or breaking some shit or something.  

So it's good that my anxieties and feelings towards perfection no longer elicit this type of fear.  But at the same time, that was a good motivator.  Fear of failing horrifically meant that I would never have to worry about being motivated.  Indeed, the intense fear and anxiety I often felt motivated me to keep working when others may have quit.  I have a better work ethic than almost anyone I know, and I think those who do really well (academically) also have this feeling of fear.  You often hear about tortured, successful people.

But I had a glimpse of going back into this type of pit earlier this week.  I had tried last weekend to do some homework and ultimately failed, because I ( and the rest of the class) and no idea how to do it.  Our teacher assigned something last Wednesday and made it due this Wednesday, but only taught us how to do it Monday.  So I wasted time on the weekend trying to figure it all out, unsuccessfully, and had to do it the night before, going to office hours from 5-8:30 and working on it before and after that.  I finished around midnight and had to eaten for 14 hours so I ordered food and collapsed, ultimately being tired the next day.  This is the only experience of this caliber I have had this year (the year is young...) but I have had many experiences like this over the years.  This type of shit is what made me want to transfer....  Anyway this caused me so much stress that it brought bad all my anxiety and I could feel the weight slowly pressing me down again.  Everything that annoys me and had ceased instantly came back.  I feel terribly depressed, and was worried that I had lost any sort of clairvoyance I gained in the past months.  

Since then I have bounced back though.  I have made it back to way I have been generally feeling the last few weeks.  But I realize that these experiences are often more common and their repeated assault on my is what beat me into submission the lat few years.  These terrible things worked in tandem with my natural anxiety to make me an emotional wreck.  

So I stuck between two modes: adrift in a sea of non interest and buried underneath incredible stress and depression.  I suppose the former is preferable, but I think neither is optimal.

I think this general lack of enthusiasm is part of why I and not interested in Sidney anymore.  I thinkI am done with her for good, but it's unfortunate the she falls into the category of things I don't care a whole lot about (which is everything).  

I do think it is good that I am over her though.  Technically she should be getting back to me about how she feels about the relationship thing, but it has been probably two weeks, and in that time I have lost all interest.  By which I mean ALL interest.  It was interesting to me that all of the sudden I jus didn't care at all anymore.  I still greatly value her friendship though, I don't want to omit that.  But romantically, I am totally over it.  And even if she says she wants to get back together, I will say no.  I don't think I want to frustrate myself again.

So now I am on the lookout once again.  While I have had a girlfriend in the last year, I have amazingly not had se for about two years...  Which is pretty shitty honestly.  One of my goals this year is to have sex.  And rally would like to achieve that goal.

Anyway, I am going to a screening tomorrow for group therapy.  I do not know if I will do it, or try to do personal sessions instead, so we will see.  Physics midterm coming up that I am not worried for....  We will see how that goes as well.   Off to bed - up at 7.  

I am grateful for this journal, I think its great when I make time for it.

Hang in there.

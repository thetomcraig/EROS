	<string>The college stuff is worrying me. And so is Sidney. I'm afraid I'm going to have to break up with her.  Getting really tired of her not actually being a girlfriend. It's going to suck if it comes to that but I may have to break up with her. 

Two midterms coming up, then I get to go home. Going to surprise mom for Mother's Day. 

Wednesday and Thursday were my weekend so I worked all day Friday, Saturday, and today. Only really took a big break to watch a movie with Sidney and Nate. 

I'm feeling good about 64 and not stats, should hopefully have enough time to study. 

Can't wait to time, still worried about colleges, freaked about Sidney. I just don't k is of it can so it anymore. Of course, I'm also just tired if her because I'm spending too much time with her. I may feel this way because of that but I think I feel this way and the situation is bringing it to light. 

I guess I'll sleep on it :/. Nothing is ever really easy it seems </string>

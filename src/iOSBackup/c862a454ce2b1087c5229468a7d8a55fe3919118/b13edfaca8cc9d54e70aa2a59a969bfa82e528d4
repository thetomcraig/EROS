	<string>Not shitty!
Had a shitty morning - woke up groggy because I was up late working on cs, and was confused in my 8 am class.

But I tried hard to not have this affect me for the rest of the day because I am trying to be more present and I don’t want to have one bad thing ruin an entire day for me.  And this pretty much worked.  The rest of the day until now has been good, and I am in a pretty good mood.

I am nervous because this quarter hasn’t been impossibly hard yet.  It’s mid-week three.  I would like to have a relatively relaxing final quarter, and it looks like this can happen, not sure how hard my classes will become.  I have a mild case of seniority - its seniority for me but I feel like I am still putting it much more work for my classes than my peers.  And I think this is okay.  I wish I didn’t fee they way I do right now - which is that I really don’t give a shit about my classes.  I am still interested in the material - but I am just not really driven like I normally am.  It’s uncomfortable for me.  I feel like I am normally driven just because I feel like if I don’t give it my all, I will fail my classes.  I don’t really eel this way currently because I don’t think I can fail my current classes.  I mean I can always fail if I just don’t even try, but I feel like trying the amount I am now - I probably won’t fail.  So I am not driven in the same way.  I know that if I don’t try I will fail so I’m still driven in that sense - but I don’t feel like i have to constantly be doing everything perfectly. 

I think this is good because its a healthy mentality - whereas my normal mode of operation is not.  But it still makes me nervous because it’s now how I am used to feeling.  

I am going to have to do a not of adjustment when I finally graduate and start working because I think I am going to have to transition to this kind of feeling all of the time - and I think that because I have been doing well for the past 4 years acting a certain way - it will be very hard to change.  I am interested in seeing how this quarter goes - and hey, it’s the last one.

Still doing mediation, trying to do it more, and trying to be mindful and present.</string>

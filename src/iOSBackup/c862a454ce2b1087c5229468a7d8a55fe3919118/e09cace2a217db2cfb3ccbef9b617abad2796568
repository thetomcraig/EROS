	<div>8. Idea is what the mind perceives and thinks. Quality is the subject. Objects power to produce ideas is its quality</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>9. Qualities are inseperable from physical bodies</div>

	<div>11. Impulse is how bodies produce ideas in us</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>12. Objects produce in us ideas about themselves</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>13. The ideas of secondary qualities are also produced via our senses. Motions produce ideas</div>

	<div>15. The ideas of primary qualities are resemblances of them. Ideas based on secondary qualities bear no resemblance. </div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>16. Some of the ideas we receive from objects really exist within them. </div>

	<div>21. How can something produce two conflicting ideas? It depends on the receiver. </div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>22. Primary or real qualities are not the same as secondary or imputed qualities</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>23. Qualities are of three sorts: primary qualities that exist independt of inspextion, secondary qualities that produce ideas within us, and tertiary qualities that allow bodies to change (Powers). </div>

	<div>1. The mind has the power to change itself and others. </div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>3. Power has some sort of relation. Our idea of power is similar to that of ideas</div>

	<div><u>39-41</u></div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>1. The mind is given ideas by the senses, and by reflection.  The ideas rare often organized and collections are referred to as a single idea.  Substance is what we call the substratum wherein these ideas do exist.</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>2. Examining this, we find that we know only of the qualities that produce these suppositions within us.  These qualities are called accidents.  It is hard for us to determine where the qualities reside.  We know there is <i>something</i> there but not what exactly.</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>3. We have certain collections of ideas about certain substances based on observations.  Common experiences form schemas for common objects.  Observable qualities in objects form its true observable qualities.  Therefore we describe objects as things with qualities.</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>4. We cannot imagine single ideas existing alone very easily</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>5. Operations of the mind we cannot imagine as existing in and of themselves, so we attribute them to the spirit.  We can hardly prove the existence or non-existence of the spirit.  Can we even say the body exists if we do not have a a concrete notion of matter?</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>6. So our collections of ideas are unioned to create substances that we represent to ourselves </div>

	<div>9.  Personal identity.  But what is a person? - Thinking, intelligent being that can reflect and consider itself.  Perceives.  Personal identity is considering oneself as separate from others</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>10.  But is does the self stay the same substance?  But what can we say of forgetfulness? Are we not just our memories?  Is one Person the same today as yesterday, is this the same as being the same substance?</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>11.  All parts of our bodies are parts of our <i>self</i> in a sense that they are part of the substance that is us a person.  Cutting off our limbs we are the same person, so the self is not just physical </div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>15.  In resurrection, the same <i>man</i> comes back.  If a prince should inhabit the body of a cobbler, is it the same man?  He is still the cobbler to everyone but himself.  How can we determine when a person is <i>the same?</i></div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>16.  Soul does not alone make a man, consciousness of present and past actions.  Does simply having memories mean you constitute the same self?</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>17.  Self is aware of pleasure and pain, emotions.  Is the self inseparable, does it exist in the physical being?</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>18.  Morals exist in the self.  If the little finger is removed, it does not have any knowledge of the self, but the rest of the body is still conscious of itself regardless of the finger.  Did it lose some of itself?</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>19.  Physicality is not everything.  Punishing awaking person for their sleeping actions is somewhat lie punishing someone for their twin's actions</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>20.  If you forget your past actions, are you a  different person?  Do you need to be conscious of your past to retain it as part of yourself?  So when are you not yourself?  When you are drunk or mad?  We tend to say that a person is "not himself" so perhaps we feel this intuitively</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>25.  Consciousness is indeed memories, we still view the self as a union of substances.  If something should break from this union, it can become part of a mother man, and thus several selves can be united.  A substance that is part of the union of a specific being is part of that self.</div>

	
	
	
	
	
	<div>26.  <i>Person</i> is a name for this self a person refers to <i>himself</i> and this is equivalent to someone calling him a person.  This is linked to the pursuit of happiness.  Upon judgment day, how will we be judged in relation to this self idea?  What about our past lives if thy exist?</div>

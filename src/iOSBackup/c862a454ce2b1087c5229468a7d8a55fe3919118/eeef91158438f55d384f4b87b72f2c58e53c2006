	<string>Six Figures

Well I interview with Pandora and actually got an offer.  I either haven’t heard or have been denied by other companies.  But pandora is offering me $100,000 a year which is unbelievable to me.  I was expecting somewhere around 80 thousand, but this is crazy.  Cost of living is high in the bay area (Oakland), but still.  I am going to sign the papers by the end of this weekend so the decision is pretty much made.  I was bummed because I was interviewing with Evernote and they said they didn’t want to move forward.  So I was kinda bummed about that.  I wish I was more confident.  

I just still feel kind of stressed and seeing as I am about to sign this agreement I am kind of terrified.  But also very excited.  

I am not sure the drugs I have been taking are working the best.  I have been feeling kind of depressed as opposed to just anxious.  But I am going to try to see a psychiatrist when I am hoe for winter break.

But I am still really excited about working.</string>

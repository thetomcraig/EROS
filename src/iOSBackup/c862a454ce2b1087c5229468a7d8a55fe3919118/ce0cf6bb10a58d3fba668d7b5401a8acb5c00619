	<string>New drugs.
So, on the new drugs (Zoloft).  Not much change so far.  Still kind of tired all the time which I think is a side effect of the old drugs.  Been doing homework and the like, and getting ready for my Pandora in person interview, coming up on Tuesday.  Flying to Oakland and interviewing, then flying home for Thanksgiving all in one day.  

I am nervous but also really excited about the Pandora thing.  I've spoken on the phone with members of the team over there and I think they like me so this should be a final interview.  I am not sure how much of it will be technical but I think a large portion will be.  

I am still stressed.  I have been doing a good job of doing meditation, mindfulness, yoga, and other things but it is still hard for me.  And I guess that's the reason for being on some sort of medication, so I guess Ill wait a bit more.  

I also had a Microsoft interview recently.  I am not sure how it went because it wasn't exactly what I was expecting...  But I also am going to have a phone call with Evernote son concerning a possible job opening, so I guess I am not so concerned about landing a job.

I am looking forward to going home.  I haven't been able to since the beginning of this quarter so that should be exciting - and I think Sidney can visit for a couple of days this coming quarter.

I think I am doing better on some things, my computer crashed a few days ago and will not boot, and I have surprisingly not been incredibly stressed about it.  But on the other hands there are still hands in my room which isn't;t a huge deal because they are not numerous, but it is still driving me fucking nuts.  I think I need to keep on trucking for now, but I will have more to say soon about my Pandora interview and other things.

	<string>Weekend at home, pretty good and almost over.  Got a tide here in Nick's truck - he's a cool guy.  Did chores around the house and I've finished up the SURF application, I just have to ask for the letter from Conrad, on the day before.  Got a new phone because my camera was messed up, trying to get a third Nexus, but Google is being stupid.  Have to go to the registrar's office when I get back to school and this should be the last of my paper work for transferring and what not.  

Finished The Stand, great book.  Also did some work on Computer Science project, which is a shitshow.  Just combining everyone's stuff is a challenge. and the girl in my group who never did anything still isn't doing anything.  Did some work on it, would have something to show for our efforts on Friday.

Deleting music, have too much bad stuff, down to ~53 GB.

I miss Sidney, going to see her tonight.  </string>

	<string>Back in school.

Well I’m back.  Shit hasn’t gotten real yet, as I have only had one real assignment so far, but it’s huge.

Been stressed and kind of depressed.  I have been seeing a therapist over here and I really like him so that’s good.  I also talked to a psychiatrist and started taking some anxiety medication but will have to wait a bit longer to see the results.

Sidney and I had sex yesterday.

So yeah.

It was really good.  Painful for her at first but we tried for a while and then it got better.  It wasn’t really pleasurable for her but we are going to keep working on it.

Other than that not much else is going on.  I talked to someone at Pandora they other day also and I am starting to look into graduation employment.  I want to work a job for a while so I can get ready to go to Japan after I have saved a bit more and have maybe tight myself some of the language.

I’ve making time for friends but school does stress me out and after this summer I have been stressed to the point of depression.  

I was in a dark place this summer after my internship ended, and I am still mildly depressed.  I would like to see what the medication I started taking will do.

 I have also started doing Yoga, a little bit at least.  It is hard for me, like Mark Baker thought it would be, but I want to keep trying at it.  

Working at ResNet is going alright as well.  I am actually doing stuff and not shadowing, so it’s nice to be able to help people and walk around places and do stuff.

Living in the dorms again is not as much of a bummer as I thought it would be.  My RA is nice and Sidney and I have been making food lately.

Being 21 is also pretty cool.  It’s nice to be able to go somewhere and order alcohol.  

Overall things are okay right now.  But I am still anxious, and this is making me anxious, and it’s a vicious cycle.  Part of this is that I also know things are going to snowball.

Sidney and I have been better about being more independent also.  It’s good that we are not always together.

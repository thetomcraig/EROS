	<string>I saw a counselor today. She was okay, kinda pretentious. She suggested I come back next Friday also. And referred me to a "perfectionist" group. I guess I've thought about myself like that before, but never really as a big concern, maybe that's something to look into. 

Her general attitude was "aw that's too bad, you should be so sad". I really don't know what I was looking for though. I mean if all this engineering stuff takes forever to do, even when I'm not being a perfectionist, maybe transferring wont help. But it could. If I don't transfer I'll have to change something lest I become incredibly depressed, even more so than now, and it's not been the best week for me. 

Taking fewer units is something else she mentioned. I suppose I would have more time if I did this. Bit I would probably also have to take a ge I didn't really give a shit about to help. And I would end up graduating in five years.</string>

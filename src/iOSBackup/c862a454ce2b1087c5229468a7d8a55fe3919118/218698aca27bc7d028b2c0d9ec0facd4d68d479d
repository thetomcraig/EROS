	<string>Busy Summer.
Well, things have been better recently.  But I’m still really busy, and stressed.  I’m really stressed because I’ve been working on this program at JPL and working on school work when I come home.  The program is really a way for me to do my actual job faster, and as such, I eel behind.  I know that I am not really that far behind, but I feel like I am because I have produced a a lot of output.  And I have been spending so much time on my summer class recently as well.  I didn’t really eleven them when they said it would take about 2 hours a day, but it’s turning out like that.  Really, it’s not like the class is academically challenging or that I hate it.  The frustrating thing is how disorganize the whole experience is.  I missed a deadline yesterday because of this.  Granted, this wasn’t too big a deal in the grand scheme of things, but I expend a significant amount of energy just getting things in order and checking due dates.

I really want time to work on my program too, but have not had a lot of time to do that recently.

I also have been on the backpack hunt yet again.  I’m not trying to be a perfectionist, I’m just trying to find a fucking backpack that hold my stuff and doesn’t hurt to wear.  

I dropped my computer a few days ago, and made a massive dent in it.  I suppose this is another lesson.  In what?  I suppose living with imperfection?  Dealing with it and not spending a shitton of money to fix it.  Yeah, that.  

I am working on trying to be more in tune with my emotions.  I realize that what I did last school year that made me feel better was really not much more than paying attention to how I felt and accepting that emotion and really experiencing it.  Having said that though, I still am a little perturbed that I am anxious all the time.  I have thought about medication, but the problem is that it’s not debilitating or anything like that.  Maybe I should become a stoner?  I’m not so sure, but not convinced either way honestly.

I miss Sidney and I’m glad she came.

I am thinking about what I want to do when I graduate.  I’m going to find out this summer, but maybe if I could do one more internship at JPL before I go travel that would be good.  Just as a buffer period, and as a way to get my plans in order and save up some money.  And maybe teach myself some Japanese as well.

Mom and dad are at Laguna this weekend but I stayed so I could focus on doing my homework.  How awesome is that.  Better get to it then.  I have a shitty report to do that I don’t care about, and more dumb lectures to watch.  I wish I had more time :(.  

The good thing is that soon it will be over.  I only have two more weeks left, and after that I only have a couple of weeks left at JPL.  I am looking forward to being able to have some free time at the end of my summer.  If for nothing else, just to finish my app!

I am grateful for our new house and neighborhood which I really enjoy.</string>

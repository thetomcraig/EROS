	<string>Two more days, can't believe the quarter is almost over.  I think about it going by quickly but really, a lot has happened.  The whole Sidney thing seems so far away tooâ€¦  I don't want to forget about Adrian though, and why I am angry at him.  Angry is not the best word.  Im tired of him.

Last year he basically asked me to do things that would make him happy.  Its very simple, he was jealous of Sidney and me.  Not that I even liked her then, but he asked me to not exclude him and to fucking ask him about his interests like I gave a shit and to not raise m voice when I argued with him because it made him feel overwhelmed.  All well and dandy if I were married to him.  He said this to me with Nick Wong present as  a third party so i wouldn't dismiss what he said.  Which I would have done because it was total bullshit.  But I didn't really realize this, and did do those things.  A week later I asked him if he had appreciated that I did these things.  He said he hadn't noticed.  That broke it for me.  I said that if he had any other menial issues with me, get the fuck over them.  I always worry that I am an asshole and he (knowingly) made me believe I was.  Only over the summer in retrospect did I realize that I am not an asshole, he led me a stray.  I am not an asshole because I care about people and I dod things I don't want to do sometimes, but I give a shit and thats what matters.  Sometimes Adrain is ok, but more and more often this year he's just aggravating.  I don't care about him enough to give a shit.  I wish i wasn't in class with him because if I wasn't I wouldn't have to even talk to him.  I could cil pages with this shit but I don't even care enough to do so.  I wish I could be done with him honestly.  

Anyway I want to go home.  Test to morrow that I feel pretty good about. </string>

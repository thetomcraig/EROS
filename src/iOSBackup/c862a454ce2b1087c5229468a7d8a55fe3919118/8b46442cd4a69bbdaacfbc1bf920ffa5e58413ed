	<string>Fucking hot every day when I walk to my car. 
Working on the Raspberry Pi once again. Thinking if trying to make it into a server for when we move. Would be nice to have a small little server that I could take with me wherever. 

Not too exciting a day at work. Emailing amateur astronomers and working on my program. I feel like an idiot all the time, asking them all about things I know nothing about. But someone has to do it. And I am creating this entire system that should be used in some iteration over the next three or four years. So it is definitely interesting to say the least.  And I really do prefer this to any other job/internship I've ever had.  

I thought today about projects I want to do.  When I finish the Sumer/Hamurabi project I think I will return to the Bots project.  When I get bored of that or get it into a stage I like, I wan to make an app.  This has bee a longtime goal, and I really would like to do it.  And Estelle never got back to me so I guess it won't be for her.  I think the first app I will work on will be the music idea I have.  That's the service that tells you about new music from artists you have, which apparently doesn't exist already! 

My eyes hurt.  Need to go to optometrist.  Speaking of which, I had a dream with Katya in it last night.  Weird shit.  Really weird shit.</string>

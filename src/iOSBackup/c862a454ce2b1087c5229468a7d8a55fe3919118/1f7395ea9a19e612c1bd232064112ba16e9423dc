	<string>I got an email today addressed to "mrtomcraig[at]gmail."  Basically there is a mother Tom Craig out there and I'm getting his emails.  I called someone who emailed alternate Tom Craig and asked him to give other Tom Craig my phone number.  Hopefully we'll get this resolved and I totally want to talk to  alternate me.

Got shit done on y paper today, should finish up a good draft tonight.

Interesting SEC meeting, real sales engineer type guy, I could tell he was good at his job and I definitely know that that's not the kind of thing I want to do.  Sales skills are great to have and this club is a great thing to have on my resume, but man I do not want to sell stuff my entire life.

Reluctantly lent text book to Adrian and made sure he wouldn't take it home.  He's a bit of a moocher.</string>

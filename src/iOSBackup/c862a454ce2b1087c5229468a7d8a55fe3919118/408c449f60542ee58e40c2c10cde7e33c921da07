Pretty good day.  Went to see a movie with Isabel and hung out with her, then I did a little programing, then hung out with the Sinclairs and some of their friends.  Saw Much Ado About Nothing with Isabel and it was pretty good, much better than I thought.  My 2 projects coming along well.  I am doing objective C for them which is cool, one will be a mac app and the other an iPhone app.  Played a board game with Jack, the Sinclairs, and two of their friends, and Ivan Pyzow.  He seemed well.  He made an offhand remark about being mean to me in elementary school. which is interesting because I remember being a dick to him instead.  I don't know maybe I could be remembering wrongly… Not sure.  Regardless it was nice to see him.  And the other guys seemed pretty good too.

My birthday is tomorrow, still kind of not looking forward to it.  I don't really know why, I think it's because it's an opportunity for me to not be pleased with something.  I think right now I am concerned hints being perfect and my preference for perfection.  My birthday may not be perfect, so I am just upset ahead of time.  Which is dumb… I don't know.

I have also pretty much decided that I will not go abroad.  I would rather work one or two more summers and make some more money; if I went to Japan this year, I wouldn't be able to work this summer.  If I can get more money and use it myself to travel after graduating, I'd much rather do that… Especially because I want to travel when I graduate anyway.  I think I'd rather go to Japan when I graduate and hopefully have more money to spend than I do now.  Something to think about.

My eyes hurt, I'm going to bed.

I am grateful for friends and friendly people.</string>

# EROS
This project is where I test various ideas for natrual language processing and teach myself new technologies.

Because I am interested in machine learning and natural languge processing, 
I am writing a modular tool to scrape social media posts from the web, 
and perform certain algorithms like markov chain generation on the raw data.

Currently I want to test automating my social media presence.  
And I want to test creating a botnet from bots that mimic real world twitter accounts.

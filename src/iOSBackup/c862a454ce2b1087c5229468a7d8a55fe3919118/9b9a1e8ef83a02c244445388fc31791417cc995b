	<string>Not so relaxed…
Well I am three weeks into my job at JPL, and its going by really quickly.  Not because I am really enjoying unfortunately.  On the contrary, its actually really frustrating.  Not like what I was doing last year, much much more boring.  It’ mostly sifting through massive files directories and using incredibly tedious programs to do mundane tasks.  But I suppose thats why I am doing it rather than someone who makes more money.

My online class is equally frustrating, not organized well even though the teacher is very well intentioned. 

All in all I am pretty frustrated.  I really just want to work on my app and finish it but keep having to do other shit like this fucking class.

Sidney is coming to visit today.  I don’t know why but I am not really at all excited to see her.  I know I will enjoy seeing her and on some level I am looking forward to it, but I am more frustrated with this shit I have to do than anything else.  I honestly just want to work on my app and thats it.  But I know I will enjoy seeing her…

I don’t know why it makes me so furious.  I just feel useless when I can’t work on it.  I started the project last summer and I really just want to finish it already.  Even if I go back to work on it I just want to have it done.  I think I am just trying to conform to this image I have of myself, and it makes me really nervous all the time that I don’t match my own expectations.  This is the same at work; I feel like I should be getting more done even though I know I am working as quickly as I can.

I think I need to work on acceptance.  Really accepting who I am and and being happy with that, rather than expecting myself to conform to some notion.  

What does make me happy is that I do like my job overall; I like the people involved and I like the work environment.  I like our new house and I am looking forward to next year at SB because I am pretty sure I am living in a nice apartment complex.  I am looking forward to seeing Sidney and I am grateful for her.  I am happy that I can spend some time doing what I love and I really enjoy programming and working on projects and things of that nature.

This class will be over soon and I am looking forward to the rest of the summer.

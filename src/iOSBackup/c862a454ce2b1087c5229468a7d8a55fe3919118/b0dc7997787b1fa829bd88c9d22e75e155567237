	<string>Got a good amount of work done this weekend.  Hopefully by the end of this week I will finish my CCS and college transfer applications, so that will be a lot off my plate.  Should get enough done to not be super busy while at home.  Definitely looking forward to being home soon!

Went to Portola tonight with Nate and Sidney, interesting experience, all the people different and everything.  I liked it though, I'd like to go again sometime.

I'm surprised how easy it was for me to get used to not having sex with Sidney.  I thought it would really bother me to have a girlfriendI couldn't have sex with.  Indeed it was a big concern to me when I was considering being in a relationship with her, but it actually isn't that bad.  Id like to of course, but it's not like I can't bear not having sex with her.  I also have the sneaking suspicion she will eventually be ready for that.  I mean she may never, which is okay, but based on what we did on my bed this weekend, I think she is surprising even herself.

Kissing for example, was something she really was awkward with, and often I feel she did it just because I wanted to, but I can tell, and she said so, that now she actually does want to.  She is becoming physically attracted I think and though she still hasn't slept over, she almost has, and I bet she will eventually.  Don't get me wrong, sex would be pretty awesome, well see about that.  One can dream huh?  I mean I am a man after all.

Halfway through the quarter - this year is going by incredibly quickly.  Next quarter I will only have Sidney in one class most likely, but our classes will be at the same time.  I think this might actually strengthen the relationship, I think she probably feels the same.</string>

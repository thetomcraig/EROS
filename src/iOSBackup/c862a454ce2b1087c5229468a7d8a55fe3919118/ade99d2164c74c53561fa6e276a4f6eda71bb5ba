Week 6 out of 10 almost done!  I really can’t wait to get out of here.  Things have been going ok.  I definitely have been feeling more adjusted this quarter, but I still have the issue of emotion.  It’s almost as if the mediation and mindfulness stuff I have been working on has reduced my anxiety, but all my other emotions with it.  I don’t really understand why, but I don’t feel as stressed, happy, sad, or anything else.  It’s like the knob has been turned down on everything.  Which is kind of how I felt when I was taking the antidepressants.  Like all of my motions were turned down or something like that.  

Sunday and I spoke a few times about the end of the year and it does make me sad, but I couldn’t cry like she did.  Lately when I have been feeling sad I have felt like I wanted to cry, but could not.  Crying is like cathartic, and I have been unable to do it lately.  I have not been feeling as stressed, and I attribute this largely to the mediation, but there have been several situations wherein I have been unable to cry. I feel like everything in my life hinges on stress, and with stress/anxiety absent, nothing else really feels quite right.  I have been trying to be present with the happy and sad moments, but it has not been allowing me to really regain the happiness.  More like contentment.

I think this is kind of missed up with senioritis as well.  Because I really don’t give a shit any more, and just want to get out of here.  But at the same time I feel like I should be sad for leaving, like I should feel like I will miss UCSB, but won’t.  Of course I know that I will, but it won’t be in the cliche way that most people do, I think: those were the best years of my life etc…

Sidney still does not have a job, and neither does Crystal.  I can tell that it is making them bot anxious, and the fact that Sidney has not found anything either makes me kind of anxious.  I think because it causes her stress, really.  I know that she will find something, maybe it will not be before we graduate, but I know that she will find something…  But it does complicate the whole relationship ending at the end of the year thing.

It’s really hard for me to stay present.  I had to cancel the trip to Japan I was planning upon gradation. I was going to go with Rylan but he bailed at the last minute and I was not sure I wanted to go alone and id not want to spend a lot of time on researching that stuff while I was worrying about school.  So the new plan is around Christmas time.

The result of that is that now I am thinking a lot about going to work for Pandora and moving up to the bay area.  It’s really hard to remain present when I have been feeling like I need to get out of UCSB for over three years and I now have a very exciting job to look forward to.  Yes, very hard to remain present and focus on classes.  Things have been feeling really monotonous lately as well, which is why I am glad that I am going home today with Sidney to surprise my mom for Mother’s day.  

I have decided to try teaching myself some Japanese.  I would really like to know some if I am going to postpone my trip to Japan, and feel like when I am done with school and working, I might actually have free time to that kind of thing.  So I am starting now.  I have always been nervous about that because I didn’t want to give up because it felt hard and then feel like a failure.  But I am trying to overcome that fear.  And if UCSB has taught me anything its that I can do things that are really fucking hard.</string>

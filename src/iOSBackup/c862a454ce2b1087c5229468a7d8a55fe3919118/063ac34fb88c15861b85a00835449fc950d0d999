	<string>Almost the end.
I read an article today about people being "busy" all the time, and taking pride in how miserable that makes them.  It was a very good read, and it fell in line with some of the other stuff I have been thinking about lately.  Ultimately, I want to be successful, and I want to be happy, but I have stop thinking that the latter will come from the former.  Indeed, this whole "success ≠ happiness" thing is right on the mark.  And it's a big thing for me I think.  Success, both in the grand and the everyday sense is very important to me and I think that's okay, but it shouldn't be synonymous with happiness.  

I think a lot about people who live in places no one has ever heard of, who never leave, and do the same thing for their entire life, only to be known by the people in their small communities.  People who live in places like Wyoming, in small towns who live their entire lives there, never to make their mark on the world.  I don't want this to be me; I want to make some sort of difference.  What I want to do is make product or piece of software that people really enjoy, and if I can make money doing that, all the better.  I want to have something of my mine be truly appreciated, by a fair number of people.  It's cliché to say something like "I want to make the next Facebook" and indeed, I don't really want to do something like that, because I don't think my strengths lie in managing a worldwide service, and I want to maintain control over the things I make.  No, I want to work on software like the applications made by Panic, the company that makes Coda.  That's optimal for me I think.  Enough people using my product so I feel like I am making difference (hopefully money) but not too many people to drive me crazy.  

Anyway, this dream is just fine.  The problem is my disdain towards the small town farmer, fisher, bar tender, whatever.  I would hate to be this person.  Why?  I guess because I wouldn't feel like what I was doing was of any worth.  Why?  Because there wouldn't be a bunch of people who knew my name - I wouldn't be in a well known place like California.  But this is all "success" who gives a shit if I am not a household name?  Well I do care.  And this is fine, because it is giving me ambition.  Achieving goals, and pursuing them is great, but I assume that this is where my happiness will come from.  Not from those around me.  There are plenty of happy people who I have never heard of, who aren't known out of their small town, or who haven't done something to make them known to thousands.  And this is something I haven't thought about recently.  Chasing success, is just like buying new things and being dissatisfied with them.  It's just like studying for 12 hours for a final for fear of failure.  For fear of imperfection.  That's the issue.  Perfect things make me happy.  So do perfect situations and encounters.  

But this is not the way I should be living my life.  Perfection is impossible.  Always.  The issue, especially with schoolwork, is that the desire for perfection causes me to work to death and produce good results.  That benefit is an outcome of my striving for perfection, and serves to make me work harder towards perfection, a vicious cycle. 

This has much to do with my notion that you are what you do.  I work hard all the time, so I am a hard worker, boom.  Done.  But this is not the case.  You also do what you are.  Mark believes (and so do I) that I do not think people will like me for who I am, because I am imperfect.  Indeed I am, as most people are, and this frightfulness and guilt towards my own imperfection cause me too seek it out externally.  In my possessions, encounters, friends and relatives, work ethic - everything. 

Well okay, this is all well and good, what's the solution? (I know I have gone over this before, but I am reiterating here, sue me).  The solution is personal relationships.  The more I emotionally connect with others, and the more I accept them and myself in spite of inherent imperfection, the more I will hopefully be less bothered by imperfection around me.  Hopefully.  Though it seems to make a certain amount of sense.

Knowing people like me -&gt; feeling more accepted -&gt; being less concerned about my own imperfection -&gt; being less concerned about other kinds of  imperfection -&gt; being able to accept others more -&gt; forming more, and better relationships -&gt; sharing emotion -&gt; knowing people like me -&gt; repeat.

Basically, being more accepted and loved will make me feel more secure.  Because all of this shit comes from personal insecurity.  And I am going to try to do this.  But there are a few concerns raised.

Sidney.  I don't know what to about my relationship with her, especially as it relates to this issue.  Should I try to be with her again this year?  The problem is that I want to have sex with her, and did not do so last year.  Causing a lot of anxiety for me.  Best case scenario would be that she says she does want to get back together and does eventually want to have sex.  I see this as possible at least, because I noticed her being a bit more attached we were getting very close towards the end of the year.  But what if she says yes but she doesn't want to have sex?  This is the most likely thing for her to say I think.  This is what she said last year and I thought I was okay with it.  I don't think I am really.  Sex is really important to me in a relationship and It's difficult to sleep with someone and make out with them and take off their shirt, and NOT have sex.  It jus felt to me like she didn't want to deal with it, not that she din't WANT to have sex.  Which is probably the case.  Regardless, I like everything else about her, and sure there were some issues, but I am not sure they would be as important if sex were part of the relationship.

Well let's say she says yes she will have sex eventually and all is well and good on that front.  Are there not other things that bothered me about her?  What about the fact that she wasn't too hot on pda?  What about the fact the she never told her parents about us?  What about her never using the words 'boyfriend' or 'girlfriend'?  What about how she acted like we were friends whenever we spent time with out shared friends (something she admitted to)?  How much of this should bother me, how much is part of this perfectionism thing?  Does it matter?  I really don't know at all.  

She could also say no, she didn't want to be with me.  I don't really think this will happen, mostly because she said so...  She said that her feelings wouldn't change over the summer.  But you never know, really.  She could be totally off me for all I know.  That's something to be prepared for.  And if that does happen, at least I won't have to worry about the relationship stuff.  And I can still be her friend, and that is really important I think.  

I really don't know...  I think I am going to have to wait and see.  And keep fantasizing about her until then...  Maybe I will ask Mark about it, though I find asking a therapist for relationship advice kind of lame.  Oh well.

Anyway here I am at the beach, going home tomorrow.  Moving lots of stuff down here from home.  It's relly sad over there with all the pictures off the wall and stuff.  But moving is necessary, and getting rid of stuff is nice too.  My summer is wrapping up, and I am alone with mom and dad.  It's really a shame that my job ended when everyone had left already, so now I have free time after being done with JPL and nobody is around to hang out.  It's good for my project at least.  I counted the other day and I have written over 1500 lines of code in a few weeks, which is pretty cool.  And I will be proud to eventually release my mac app, even if only 3 people download it.  But it is kind of a bore, and it's not good for forming those all important emotional relationships and such!

Well I have to go to bed - I always write in here at night.  Which I don't mind.  Anyway I am going to sleep, I hope there is more exciting stuff to talk about next time.

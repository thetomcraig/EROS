	<string>So Sidney slept over the night before last. I spent all day Saturday with her, as she woke up with me and we worked together. I did some work and we went to Kevin's party last night. I felt like she wanted me to get drunk, I think she just wanted me to have a good time, not sure. Got to see Nick C drunk and that was pretty cool. Sidney, nick, and I left before Adam and his friends, we were pretty much done, and I wanted to go to bed around 2am so I could et up early today and work. 

This did not exactly happen. I sat with some people in the bros room for a bit, and asked Sidney if she wanted my to walk her home. She said shed walk me. She walked my to my room. I wasn't really expecting much though, maybe just kiss her for a few seconds. 

Backtrack, Friday night we made out and I tried to feel her breast and was rejected. 

Anyway she practically started kissing me. And as we were going at it I did manage to make it to 2nd base. I thought I might, but another part of me thought I never would. This was not negligible. We were both a bit drunk but I don't think I took advantage. I managed to remove her shirt completely. Pretty good if I may say so myself. And during this I asked her f she was sure she was okay with it. She said she really wasn't sure, but told me not to stop either. Having a penis, I didn't stop. This continued until around 6am. Not the best way to wake up early the next day. 

She got kind of upset afterwards though, like she thinks she shouldn't have gone that far. Like she isn't sure what she wants. I'm about to talk to her about it now. I'm going to ask her if she liked it, is something she would want to do again. I'm suspecting her to say she isn't really sure, I'm hopping she doesn't say "no, never again."  Because she seemed genuinely concerned last night. 

I don't feel like I took advantage. I also don't want to feel like I twisted her arm. Which I know is true, she was not really that drunk, and she's really strong when it comes to fortitude. So well see what she says, on pins and nettles. 

Seeing Jack S was good on Friday night, I miss that dude. 

Future Tom: have you had sex with Sidney? Is this a strange question?</string>

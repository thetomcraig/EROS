	<string>Got pretty drunk last night.  Wen to Aoweis with Sidney, Scott, and Lisa, met up with Hin, Josh, and Adam.  Adam was a depressed drunk, concerned Sidney and the like i managed to figure out.  I talked to Lisa for a bit and actually had a good time with her.  Not interested in her at all of course, but she's and interesting person.  Got a text from Sidney last night saying she wanted to talk to me.  I figured she would not want to in the morning but had to put if off until then.  I brought it up and she didn't want to talk about it, no surprises there.  I plan to pull it out of her though, because her residence makes me think it has something to do with us, by which I mean "us."  

Would I like to be with her?  Yes, but it's an idealized relationship, even if we are "together" it won't ever be what I'd want from the relationship.  Ive reconciled myself to that.  Lisa thinks she still likes me, and I wouldn't be surprised if she did, but I am not sure I'd go for it if she wanted to be together.  Or maybe it's nothing like that, I don't know.  But i plan on getting it out of her, because I think a serious issue that goes unresolved festers.  Even if it isn't resolved it should be out there, so everyone is on the same page.  Also I'm super curious.  I'll bug the sit out of her, I'm okay with that.  

Played around with Arduino, bought my own thats coming in the mail.  Started thinking about what to program for the robots club, looks like I might actually have time for the club!  And my schedule is fucked.  Conrad teacher cs56 sometimes, so if I can take it with him next quarter, I'll drop it right now in an instant, current teacher, Cappello, seems like a problem.  On top of that letters of rec for JPL job and for transferring colleges, forms to turning and the like, AND homework.  Much to do, going to get back to it.</string>

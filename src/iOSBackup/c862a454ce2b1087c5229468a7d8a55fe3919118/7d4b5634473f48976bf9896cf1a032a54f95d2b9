	<string>What a long week.  Monday and Tuesday were fine, Wednesday and Thursday I was up late programming the bot. Thursday night we decide it really wasn't going to work out and bailed on the competition. I had seen it coming, and it's one less things for me to worry about right now. 

Last night I didn't do much, tired.  Do a bit of homework, ran early and went into the ocean halfway through. Then Sidney slept over. I took her shirt off again this morning and again she seemed worried about going too fast. It annoys me because I know she really likes it. She's really into making out and I can tell she likes it when I feel her up, but taking her shirt off is too much for her right now. It's a bit annoying. 

Went to Holi today. Indian celebration - kids throwing paint at each other on the beach. It as really fun - went with Sidney and Nate. The. Didn't really get a lot of homeowner done today but I should be able to cram a fair amount into the coming days. 

I'm good with Sidney. It kind of annoys me because it feels like two steps forward and one step back sometimes, but overall she makes me really happy he unlike it when she sleeps over. 

Idea for the pi - Super Nintendo emulator. Might be cool to have one to entertain people, and building the controllers to be wireless and making the housing myself would be cool. 

Project looking better bit by bit, going to present or talk about hat next week with CCS people. </string>

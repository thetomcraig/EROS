	<string>Goodbye.

Writing on the new iOS (7)! It's nice. 

Anyway going back to school tomorrow. Honestly I can't wait. You wouldn't think I would; seeing how much I dislike it there, but I really can't wait to go back. Talking to mark has made me realize how important I need to make people in my life, and I want to go back and see all my friends. It sucks that I finished working at JPL right when everyone went back to school. The last couple of weeks in summer have always been like this because ucsb starts so late. It's really too bad. Especially because of all the moving I have been having to do with mom and dad. It's boring and kinda of sad, having to leave this house. 

This is my house.  More than anyone else, really, because I grew up here.  I have spent my entire life living in this house. So it's sad to leave. But at the same time I haven't really let the sadness touch me; because everyone else has been sad enough, and because I know we have been needing to move for 3 or 4 years. It bugs me when things take too long. I guess because I am so slow myself. 

But I can't wait to go back. And I am determined this year to make people more imprint and in my life. I think every year I am determined to do something differently, and don't really become satisfied. But hey, I think that's better than deciding I can't ever change. And I so really think I can make people more important in my life. 

I haven't stopped thinking about Sidney. I have become less worried about it though, I guess because I want to have her in meh life in whatever capacity I can. Though more writing about her won't do any good, because I am sure seeing her tomorrow will make me feel differently. Life is weird like that. So much can change.  So that's all I can do about that now. 

I wonder how long until I find myself writing about some other girl in here. I have typed her name more times than I can remember, it's weird to think I may be obsessively writing about some other girl in here; typing her name over and over; probably discussing the same issues. 

But Sidney is special, I can say that. It's not often you meet someone you really click with. She and I are a lot a like. 

Anyway this is the last night I will lie here, in this bed, listening to the crickets. I still don't feel terribly sad about it, but I am sure I will soon enough. That I am sure of. 

I remember lying here in second grade and looking out the window in the hall, seeing a streetlight. The light was on oak street and a girl I liked lived near it. Her name was heather. Come to think of it, she was one of the first girls I really liked. I would always look thought the window, across the street at that street light and think of her. That she was so close. And even since then, I've looked out at it when I can, thinking about that feeling. About home. And the branches in the trees have obscured the view and the light has long since burnt out. I even think heather moved out of that house.  But I still think about that feeling. About my elementary school days in this town; about home. 

That's one of the constants, like listening to the crickets in the summer every year and watching the fireworks and seeing the kids to to Marengo. I suppose south Pasadena really is anywhere USA, something my friend Nina once said to me. But I like that. I like this town a lot.  And I think it's time to go. 

I am sure I will be wishing I was home soon enough at sb, but that home will now be Laguna beach. And I am fine with that. It's time to say goodbye I guess. It feels right. </string>

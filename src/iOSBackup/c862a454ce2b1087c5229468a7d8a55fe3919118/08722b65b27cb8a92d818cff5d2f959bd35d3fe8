	<string>I emailed some Caltech people about doing a SURF this summer. Still waiting for a response from one guy who asked if Pri was my boss when I worked at Caltech last. Perhaps be is contacting her about me. I'm not sure but I know she liked me, so this could be good news. I plan on being on top of it this year and I think I should be able to snag a SURF thing. I almost got one last year. </string>

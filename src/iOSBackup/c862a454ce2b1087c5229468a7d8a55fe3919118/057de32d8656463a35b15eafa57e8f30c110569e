	<string>Sorry for delay. 

Once again I've delayed writing in here, but I have been doing well in other things. 

Last quarter I was able to actually make something more important in my life and not be doing homework constantly. The fact that I got a C+ D+ was not because of that for what it's worth...  

Anyway I am trying to step it up a notch this quarter, I've been stretching, sling sit-ups, doing push-ups and meditating every morning, and I have been confounding to make time to read every night. This weekend I spent a lot of time with friends too, which is something I am trying to make a larger priority.  I saw my friends who live in the campus apartments - Josh, Adam, Nick Clinton and Nick Wong. And Sidney and I saw out friend Dalin and his girlfriend and we went out to see the hobbit. 

Today Sidney and I worked but manger to go to the beach for a bit too a which was nice. It's hard for me to not be constantly doing homework that need to be done, but overall I think it's healthy for me. The same foes for running, which I am going to star doing more often. Having three classes this quarter I think will allow me some leeway. Having said that, I can tell shit is going to get real in all my classes soon, so I am trying to prepare for that. 

Sidney and I are pretty good. I missed her a lot over the break. We still are not at the sex stage, but may be relatively soon. Have had a few talks about how to make the relationship better. 

Also no idea about housing next year..

I am falling asleep. I am grateful for manzanita. </string>

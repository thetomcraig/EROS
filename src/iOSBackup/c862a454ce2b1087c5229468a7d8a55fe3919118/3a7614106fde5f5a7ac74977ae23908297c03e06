	<string>Flying by.

My senior year is flying by, but not really because I’ve been having fun.  I’ve been really fucking busy with three cs classes and trying to find a job.

I have been interviewing with Pandora and I am actually going to fly out to Oakland in the next couple of days to do an in person interview.  

The drugs haven’t really been working yet…  It’s been 5 weeks and apparently they can take up to 6.  

I have also continued to see Jeremy (therapist) and I have been going to a mindfulness/meditation group here on campus.

So I have been meditating and being mindful and also doing yoga and taking drugs.  I am also going to be writing in here more often… Or at least I will try to.  

I feel like I have been doing  all of these things but haven’t seen a lot of progress.  It’s tough though because part of me is so resistant to feeling better because I am so used to not feeling good at all.

So I am going to keep doing the things I have been doing, but I really wish I could feel better already!

Nothing to do but keep trying.  I have been disenchanted with the whole self-betterment mindfulness train and all of that, but I feel like I have to try, because what else is there to do?

Another thing in regards for awareness, and that’s paying attention to good things that happen.  And on that note…

Sidney and I are actively having sex which is pretty sweet.  We have issues here an there but our relationship I think is really good right now.  I am very grateful for the friends I have also and I have been spending a good amount of time with them I think.  

I also felt good about myself when I did my technical phone interview yesterday with Pandora.  I was incredibly anxious about it but I think I answered the question really well and did a good job of talking through my methods and testing and all of that stuff.

So overall, really fucking busy a stressed right now but trying to be more aware of it and mindful about the good (and bad) things in my life.</string>

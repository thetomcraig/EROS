	<string>"Itâ€™s very possible that if you have a life filled with that constant stress, little by little the body is breaking down."

That's something to work on...  I need to do something like reinventing myself.  Judging others and myself on just actions is not working.  Something I do what I am.

Saw Isabel today, it was nice.  Talked to her about the shitty men in her life and my relationship with Sidney, which I am unsure about continuing - but I probably will want to go for.

I am glad she is my friend - Isabel that is.  I need to have good friends who I can actually have meaningful emotional interactions with.

Anyway out's bed time, I would write more but I haven't really done anything too exciting.  Just been moving boxes from our hose to Doreen's house to store, and selling stuff.  And doing a lot of programming.  But aside from that, nothing.  Which is good.  I will have some version of my program done by the time I go to school and that will be nice.  

I am thinking about meditation...  But more on all of this later!

I am grateful for my friend Isabel.</string>

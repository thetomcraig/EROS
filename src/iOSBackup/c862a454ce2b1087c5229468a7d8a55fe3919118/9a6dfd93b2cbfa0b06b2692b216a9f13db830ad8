	<string>Met with Glenn Orton today; went pretty well.  Purdy sure the job is mine, and I hear officially on two days.  Don't want the break to be over, though I want to see my friends.  

Teaching myself to type properly - going pretty well.

Not much else, just hinging out watching TV and working on my project.  Hope Im not getting sick againâ€¦ Pink eye not my jam.</string>

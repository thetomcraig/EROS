	<string>Open this app to be greeted with an error saying my password was wrong.  Had to fuck around to make it work.  Whatever.  Realized today that I had more writing for colleges than I thought I did.  I am almost done with apps, should be able to finish tomorrow or the next day.  Just in time to go back to SB :/  I fee like this quarter will be better than last, but I always feel that way so well see what happens.  I'm applying to Vanderbilt, Brown, Rice, and Oxy as a backup.  Feel pretty good about Vanderbilt; Rice and Brown might be a reach.  Brown would be super cool though, I hope I get in there.  I'm pretty fed up with SB, for a host of reasons, and I can't wait to get out of there if I can.  Having lunch with Isabel tomorrow and finishing apps.  Have to go to bed soon so I'll knock out, more soon.</string>

	<string>It's been a pretty bad couple of weeks.  I've been depressed, and had a few panic attacks; I'm tired of all this running around and working and not getting rings done.  It used to be that I didn't have much free time, then I had none.  Now I don't even have time to do all the things I don't want to do.  And now if I do have a free time I feel guilty about it.  Or I can't really do any of things I want to do in it because I'm exhausted.  There are just so many things going on, CCS, Transfer application, classes, clubs, and Sidney. 

I've been sleeping alright and not been feeling well rested, and been irritable, and I want to be away from most everyone. 

This morning Sidney asked if I was angry at her. I said no, and she said ok.  I said I was not feeling dry good, stressed/depressed, then she left.  I didn't text her for lunch, and she called.  I felt bad, but I told her I was going to eat alone.  I told her when I got back that I was sorry for not eating with her.  She said it was fine, then left.  I was beginning to get annoyed with her, and then made it to me room and say that she left a Payday on my door.  It had a note on it telling me to feel better.  This did make me feel a bit better and I comp sci'd for a long time.

Just a few minutes ago, she texted asking for her english paper that I had printed out for her.  She came over and got it.  I said thanks for making me feel better and she started acting really weird.  Like there was something obviously one her mind and she couldn't bring herself to talk about it.  I said I'd see her tomorrow and she said yes in a very weird way.  I tried to ask her what was wrong, and she said she wasn't in a good mood.  I said was it something I had done?  She said no, but I'm disinclined to believe her.  I don't understand what she could be upset with me about, but I get the feeling she is.  Then she left and I called Isabel.

About 5 minutes ago she came back and asked to see my math notes, I showed them to her and we talked about math for a few minutes like that last hour had never happened.  Then she left again.  This is fucking bizarre.  I get the feeling she is upset at me for being depressed.  I expect her to be supportive and make me feel better, isn't that what a girlfriend is supposed to do?  I feel like very often I do not feel good or I am depressed and my friends do not know how to be supportive.  

She normally is supportive though, so there must be something going on.  Maybe she is just upset about something else, I certainly hope so.

I've never been depressed for this long.  I mean maybe I have, it's been maybe 3-5 days, but its significant.  I have been steadily upset, and I would have had more panic attacks in the last week if I weren't so tired.  I am afraid its finally happened - I am burning out.  I have always been worried I would one day burnout, just stop giving a shit about the stuff I have to do.  That is basically how I feel now, I've been doing my work, but Im not really happy at all.  Im beginning to believe I haven't really been truly happy for a long time.  Something has to change because if "real life" is harder than this, I don't know if I can handle it. 

I hope the counselor I see on Friday has something to tell me that will help.</string>

	<string>Going to be writing in here more often because I have to for my engr 101 class.

I am doing an experiment that involves canning my interactions with people and gauging their reactions and thus, my overall happiness.  I am going to be trying to move the focus of my conversations towards the other person in the conversation, by asking them questions and making sure I understand what is going on with them, and by making my side more amenable to their input.

I started this today and felt like it was helpful when I talked to Sidney, as we were talking like normal and I resisted the urge to inject about myself and instead asked more questions than I normally do.  Interested to see how this progresses as I will officially start tomorrow.  Also, this number is my 1-5 feeling about my overall wellbeing concerning the conversations I have had today: 3/5.</string>

So, both Pete and I have a 9am meeting before the faculty meeting, and<br clear="none" />

But my presence is not necessary, if one or both of you was willing to<br clear="none" />
meet with Tom this Friday after the faculty meeting, or sometime<br clear="none" />
Friday afternoon (assuming that time works for him.)<br clear="none" />
<br clear="none" />
He is currently considering transferring to Occidental College where<br clear="none" />
he was accepted as a transfer student.    ( #38 among the top 178<br clear="none" />

<br clear="none" />
Both Brown and Rice turned him down as a transfer student, and he's<br clear="none" />
waiting to hear from Vanderbilt University (Nashville).<br clear="none" />
<br clear="none" />
He's putting off telling Occidental an answer until he hears from<br clear="none" />
Vanderbilt, and he's also hoping he might hear from CCS first as well.<br clear="none" />

As you may recall, we reviewed an application from a Tom Craig, CoE<br clear="none" />

student try his hand at some external projects before making a final<br clear="none" />
admit/no-admit decision.<br clear="none" />
<br clear="none" />
Since then he has done so, and is now ready to show us some of his<br clear="none" />
work.      I've been trying to schedule a time with Murat and/or Tim<br clear="none" />
Sherwood without success (for different reasons in each case) for a<br clear="none" />
few weeks now---so as we are running out of quarter, I'm going to try<br clear="none" />
the two of you as well. :-)<br clear="none" />
<br clear="none" />
Is there a time in your schedule that Tom could stop by to tell you<br clear="none" />
about his work, and for you to talk with him about CCS, and his future<br clear="none" />
plans?<br clear="none" />

	<string>Well its my birthday, and I have become a man.
Parent left yesterday, I am alone in this new apartment figuring out how to be an adult.  Oh yeah, and I broke up with Sidney yesterday.  I didn’t feel great about it.  Really, I saw the whole thing coming.  It was totally a bad idea to visit over the break.  She felt that we were going to try to keep the relationship going, even though we didn’t really verbally discuss that.  I knew she probably felt that way, and I am annoyed because I fell like she knew how I felt but was avoiding it hoping I would not bring up the breakup again.  But of course I did, because I am that kind of person, and we said we would break up at this time so I was honoring that.  There is a lot to be said about it, but I think, really, I have changed over the last year and she has not.  I don’t want it to seem like I think I am better than her, because it’s not like that.  Really, I feel like we are very similar, but have become less so over the past year as I have changed.  Things like mediation have helped a lot with my stress, and I feel that she has come to rely on me for stress management and that kind of thing.  I have enough to worry about trying to figure out my own issues and I feel like she has been piling on, so I am dealing with two versions of the same thing.  

It really resulted in me just kind of not caring.  Not that I don’t care about her, but the relationship just wasn’t really something I cared much about working on anymore.  And I think this had to do with e just getting tired of her.  I think that in the end she was less emotionally mature than I, and it took too much energy for me to deal with.  I guess one of the things that annoys me about this whole situation is that I wish I was not so sensitive, because the whole thing does not seam like a big deal really, but it is enough to make me crazy.  Just the fact that there is something bothering me and I am bothered by that fact that I am bother by it…  THAT is enough to make me crazy.  And I don’t think that really there is a way to make myself not be bothered by that situation, nor should I, really.  

I guess I am really annoyed that I just got bored.  I wish there was more emotional charge to it.  Like there was something dreadfully wrong, because it almost doesn’t seem warranted to me at this point.


Really I feel shitty about the whole thing, because I am her best friend and she loves me.  At one point I did love her, but in the last couple of months I just kind of fell out of love with her.  I feel this kind of guilt because she values me so much and loves me so much and I don’t feel like I deserve it.  I am really not attached to her as much as she is to me.

Even when we were breaking up it was hard because she said she wasn’t angry at me, but was just sad.  And she cried a lot.  I cried too, but not the same amount.  Crying is something lately I have been doing less.  Not that I should be doing it all the time, but I found that at times when it would feel good to cry, I have found myself unable to do so. 

So I feel this mix of sadness and apathy at this point.  And apathy is something I have been dealing with a lot lately.  As my anxiety has diminished, a lot of my emotions have seemed less charged.  

I am keeping busy though.  I wanted to start earlier, but was not able to do, so I am going to have to find thing stop do to keep out of my own head.  On the right track so far, only 13 more days…

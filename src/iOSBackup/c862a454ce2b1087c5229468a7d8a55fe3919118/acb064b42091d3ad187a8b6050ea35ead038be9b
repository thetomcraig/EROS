	<string>So a lot has happened.  Some meh, some good.  Nothing bad really.  

So today was nice, not a lot of homework, turned in lab and did an assignment, did laundry, made out with Sidney a lot.  Ran, played settlers of Catan with Josh and Adam and Sidney, I actually like it now.  

I got wait listed at Vanderbilt, if you can believe it, and I decided Occidental is off the list.  I don't really want to go there because Computer science is only a minor and it would be done, because I have almost finished the non computer science stuff I have to do here.  Can take Caltech classes, but only one quarter and that would be way too much of a hassle.  So for now I just wait to hear from Vanderbilt, and plan like I will be retuning to SB next year, which honestly won't be that bad.  I have to take physics next quarter, but after that I ail have most shitty classes out of the way, or so I believe.  And I am halfway through!  Only two more years, and I wish i didn't feel this way about college, but I am really done with it.  

I had a bit of a rough time with Sidney.  I told her that I didn't want to be together even if I was returning next year, and this caused some strife - tears were shed on both sides.  But after, we talked about it again and decide it would be best to break up at the end of the are without ay expectation of what is to happen next year should I return.  Which is really the best I believe.  I am also more willing to do this because she has suddenly become less reticent about lots of things, like kissing and PDA and me touching her ass and taking off her shirt.  I still want to and will not have sex with her by the end of the year BUT a lot of the other little things that bothered me are actually resolved.  I worry less about some stuff, which is good.  And she actually MIGHT come around to wanting to have sex next year, but it is hard to say right now.  Regardless, I really do like her and things are good now, and should be good for the rest of the year - two weeks!  Lots of making out and groping.  So much so that I got a little too excited todayâ€¦ which was kind of embarrassing, but not too bug a deal.  

Today I finally got over a sickness.  It made me skip all my classes yesterday and go to health, which was inconvenient, but I am glad I did it.  And i took an X-ray while I was there, and after having pneumonia, I do not have any lung problems so that is good.  I feel a bit behind, but nothing I can't catch up on.  I have one more homework assignment for each class, then I am done save finals, which are not a big deal - expect stats.  Even that is not too bad either, because I did well (relatively) on the final and the homework grades are pretty good.  So I have no problem getting at least a B in that class, and I think I MAY be able to get an A in the other ones, but well see.  I say I will probably get one or two As this quarter.  CS64 is feeling pretty good and CS138 is feeling okay, and PHIL 20C is feeling pretty good too, I got an A on the first paper and put a lot of work into the second.  So overall a lot of work coming up but nothing I can't handle.  And I will not be sick finals week!!

I just met with Adrian and Grant for SEC and told them that they should plan for me not being there this coming year, which I did not anticipate being a big deal.  Adrian asked if I would still be interested in being a member next year if I were coming back, which I did not anticipate.  But I said no, as I had come to realize that sales is not really my thing.  And both of them really didn't care.  Which as awesome - its good to have thing go better tha expect sometimes.  

I met with two CCS professors recently.  Those people are hard to talk to and often like to talk about themselves.  BUT I think it went well and hopefully I should know about CCS by the end of the year.

I am getting tired and staying up too late so I will try to wrap it up.  But important things have transpired.

I am actually happy with my Nexus tablet.  I tried to get rid of it and eventually it didn't sell on eBay and I decided to take notes with it because my back hurt from carrying around my laptop.  It was annoying until I stumbled upon swipe.  Its the keyboard in which you swipe on the keys to make words.  Its note taking heaven.  I love using it to takes notes now.  Its not the best for a lot of stuff.  But now its y favorite way of taking class notes.  So thats pretty rad.

Also the Pi had some issues with HDMI.  Im trying to make another adapter.  It f doesn't work Ill have to make a hole in the side.

I am still liking the perfectionism group a lot and I look forward to it every week.  One of the things mentioned in group recently was writ in down things you are grateful for.  I am going to stet doing that in this journal because I complain a lot in here and its a bit too negative.

Closing: I am grateful for how good things are with Sidney right now.  I also grateful for the things I put time into purchasing, like my mouse and headphones.  I am grateful that I can run on the beach.  I am grateful that I recently put a lot of time into putting my projects on Github and Flickr, and linking Aboutme to both.  They look very nice now and make me feel good about myself.

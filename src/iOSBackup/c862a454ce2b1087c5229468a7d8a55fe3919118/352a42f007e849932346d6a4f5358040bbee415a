	<string>Waiting in ccs to talk to Conrad. Almost done with asking for letters if Rec. this week has been hectic, catching up in a history class I got because I dropped cs56 this quarter. No way in taking that with an asshole when I can take it with Conrad next quarter. Hopefully I'll be caught up and have most of my shit done by the end of the weekend, but it's been prett fast paced this week and last. I ant believe its only Wednesday, and I can't believe it's only the second week. I feel like I've been here for months. 

So much happened last quarter even though it was so short. I want to freeze how I feel now, so I can look back on it in 3 months. I am nervous about the whole transfer thing, I might not get into the places I want to go, and I don't want to be stuck here, unhappy for another two years. I can tell already that  this quarter will be stressful, and I'll be spending a lot of time reading. On top if that, Sid told me she still has feelings and brought up the possibility of a relationship. This is something to think about, but I don't have time to yet. 

Talked to Conrad. College of creative studies instead of transfer?!</string>

	<string>I can't believe I'm still waiting on Vanderbilt, Oxy said yes, RIce and Brown both said no.  But Vanderbilt just hasn't said anything yet.  Its making me very nervous, and I have to keep stopping myself from thinking about next year because I will be let down if I don't get in and might feel differently if I do.  I think I can be okay with going to Vanderbilt or with staying here, but I cannot anticipate either because I don't know if I have been accepted to Vanderbilt yet.  

If i do not get into Vanderbilt, I'm not sure I even want to go to Oxy.  It seems a bit to me like I'm giving up, I guess because Waverly people went there and because its so close to home.  I remember Jack Sinclair telling me he knew someone doing computer science there and he didn't like it, so if I do not get into Vanderbilt I will have to try to get into contract with whoever that is.  

Im afraid I won't get into Vanderbilt.  I think I have an okay chance, but if I do not get in, I will feel like all the work I did last quarter was just to get into Occidental and I don't even want to go there.  It's not that it's a bad school, but it's something I know, something and wouldn't fee like change.  I thinks thats what I really want at this point in my life - change.  Vanderbilt is the great unknown, its far away and different and something I don't know anything about, and because of this is seems so exciting.  Its how I felt about Brown too, before they rejected me.  I think I will most likely hear from Vanderbilt this coming week, and next week at the latest, I really hope it is this coming week and I might even call them again.  If I do not hear by Tuesday or so.  

I am just so afraid of not getting into Vanderbilt.  I know I can stay here but I will have to be more content with this school and I feel like that means giving up and accepting mediocracy.  I don't think my standards for teachers and a university are too high, and I feel like  would be brainwashing myself if I gave up and grid to be happy amidst the shiftiness that is my classes.  I came here to learn, and I do not fee like I am being taught competently.  

Not to mention Sidney.  Leaving would mean I could end our relationship because I wouldn't be at SB.  If I do not leave, I think I may have to end it nonetheless.  Not to say this is a big reason for me to leave, but it is just one mrs thing to think about if I stated here.  

I also really want to experience something outside of California.  If I get into Vanderbilt I will seriously consider going, as for Occidental I am not so sure.

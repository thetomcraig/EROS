	<string>First move.
Well I am moving tomorrow.  Which is pretty exciting - I am really looking forward to being somewhere now and getting to do my own stuff, working and meeting new people.

In other news I finished a version of some code I was writing that can now reliably read data from my Withings account and push my daily steps to my Fitbit account.  Not super exciting, but I was glad i got some experience in API programming and it was really rewarding to get this working.  I don’t know if anyone else will want to use it, but I got a lot out of writing it.  I think I’ll let it sit for a bit and get back to some other projects before I do anything more with it.  For now I can just run it myself every now and then, pretty much whenever I want, and it is smart enough to update my Fitbit database properly and will have the correct number of steps recorded.  I’d have to build it out more and do something like make it into a web application if I wanted to make it usable by anyone else, so for now i want to focus on my natural language processing application instead, because other people can use that, and I have some cool ideas.

I am worried about the Sidney situation.  Originally, I had thought that it would have been a good idea to break up at the end of the school year, and we decided to wait until the end of the summer.  Now she is talking about visiting me maybe because she is going to be in the area in the next week or so.  This makes me really nervous.  I really do want to maintain contact with her, and I like her a lot as a friend, but I really am done being in a relationship.  I think that seeing her again so soon after she visited is a bad idea, because to her, it won’t really feel like there is any need to break up (I think).  I just can’t decide how or when I want to tell her.  

But I am really excited for the move, and sad, of course.

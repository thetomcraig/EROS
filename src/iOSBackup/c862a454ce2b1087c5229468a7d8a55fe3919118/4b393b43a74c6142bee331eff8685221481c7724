	<string>Met with some guys today concerning the robot project with Adam.  All the guys seemed pretty cool, and they reminded me of Adam.  They were all very smart, and knew a lot about electronics.  I'm quite envious of people like Adam who get by with a terrible work ethic.  It makes me frustrated often because I feel accomplished but not necessarily intelligent.  I'd like to think having a good work ethic will get you farther but I honestly don't know if that's the truth. 

I cannot finish my GOLD script no because I'm not in my pastime.  I'll have to wait until the end of the month, so I think Ill start my next project.  I want to finish up the pi over the break and the GOLD script if possible.  My next project is to make a robot capable of tweeting.  Someone did this already and published his code and I want to do something like this.  I'd like it to fabricate something and constantly update it, like a twitter account or a Facebook one.  Not sure yet.

Adrian texted me today asking me about our essay prompt.  Not that big a deal, but its a manifestation of what he always does, asks me for a condensation of what we need to know for class.  I'm just so tired of him, I really wish I wasn't in classes with him so I could be done with this.  I feel a bit like an asshole, but I honestly do not like him.  The problem is that he is to involved in my life to simply cut loose or ignore.  But something should be done I believe because while he is a cool guy some of the time I've become progressively more annoyed with him. </string>

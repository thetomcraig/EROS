	<string>Still waiting for college news, aside from Rice that is…

Wednesday and Thursday were my weekend, tonight was not that exciting and this weekend won't be fantastic either.  

Sidney is kinda getting on my nerves, I'm just spending too much time with her.  Really I wish I knew about next year and everything because it is so impossible to plan anything really.  

I had sort of reconciled myself to breaking up with Sidney at the close of the year because I would hopefully be at another school.  Now I may not even leave… I don't know if I can still be with her honestly.  

If I had to nail it down to something, its really getting on my nerves that I can't have sex with her.  That and really the whole situation feels unduly to me.  I just don't fe like I'm in a real relationship, and it doesn't feel adult at all.

I just want to hear about my colleges...</string>

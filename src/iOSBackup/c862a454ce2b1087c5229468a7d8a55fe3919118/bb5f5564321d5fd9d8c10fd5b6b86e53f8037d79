	<string>First apartment.
Well my parents just left.  Spent the last three days getting all my stuff organized in my new apartment in Oakland.  Its a really nice place, and I am so grateful to my parents for being here to help me.  I got at $5000 moving allowance from Pandora and used just about all of it to buy shit to fill up this apartment.  Ikea, Home Depot, Best Buy,  you name it.

On the one hand I feel like I deserve this; this is why I put up with 4 years of annoying school and worked hard to get a job, one that pays 6 figures no less.  On the other hand I feel like I don’t really deserve it.  Like its too much for me.  I feel guilty I guess.

Mixed in with this are my feelings about Sidney and whats going to happen with our relationship.  Which is about to end, but I am worried that she is not on the same page as me on that front.  The more I think about it, the more I wish she really hadn’t visited, because I feel like that is going to make it harder to end.  She is still in the Bay area, and I am worried about seeing her, so soon after I saw her in and we were still together.  I mean technically we still are together - as the plan was to break up at “the end of the summer”.  I just think spending some time apart would make this easier for us.  But I am nervous about how she will take it.

I guess my concern is that I will be put into a position of telling her “I want to break up”.  Even though, in my mind, we pretty much should be broken up now.  I know that she is very attached and I feel like that will lead to me having to say why i want to break up now, which in truth is that I am tired of her.  And I don’t want to say that to her because I don’t want to insult her or make her self conscious.  I suppose she is a big girl though, I shouldn’t need to get into that level of preemption for her - but I guess I am still just worried about people not liking me.  

Will report back later - be sure of it.</string>

	<string>I need to keep working on this.
I have been feeling pretty shitty recently.  My parents are really stressed about us moving stuff into this house and I am really stressed too.  Moving is hard and I have been really busy with JPL and my summer class.  The summer class is not hard but disorganized an stressful.  I come home from JPL and most days spend most of the night doing something for the class.  Honestly I feel fine when I have work and nothing else.  This of course is not a situation I will ever be in so I have to work on this.  

JPL work is stressful also because I just don’t care about what I am doing and my progress seems so slow.  So I talked to Glenn about it today and feel like I might be able to do something a bit different that will make me feel better.

I want to feel the way I did when last school year began.  I think that is more healthy for me.  I just allow myself to become incredibly stressed.  I want to focus again on my friends and personal relationships, because I think this will make me happier than what I am doing.  I really just want to spend all my time programming, but at the same time I feel bad for not moving as quickly as I would like to.

I was going to go to laguna this weekend with mom and dad but I think that I want to try to stay.  Because this will allow me to spend more time with friends which I think is what’s most important for me.

I am grateful for my friends whom I want to see desperately. </string>

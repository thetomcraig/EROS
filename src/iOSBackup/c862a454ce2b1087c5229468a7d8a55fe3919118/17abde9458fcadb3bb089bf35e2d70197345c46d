	<string>I don't have much time to write in here, but I want to get down how I am feeling right now.  Today has been good as I have been doing errands and getting stuff done.

Ultimately I may not have changed as much as I thought I did.  I was pretty stressed Tuesday night because I had something due Wednesday for computer  science and I had to teach myself how to do it.  It involved wasted hours and a lot of time in office hours; working late into the night.  When that happened, it brought back all the anger, anxiety, disdain, and perfectionism issues I have always struggled with.  But I have bounced back and have been feeling pretty good these last couple days.

So it's not perfect, and I was still stressed and angry about how much shit was piled into me that didn't need to be.  I am going to try to see ad therapist here about all of these things.  But I still think I am making some progress, though it may not be as perfect as I had hoped (sound familiar?).  

I am trying to find a job on campus too, and should here back from one today or  tomorrow.

I will talk more about all this later, I am trying to get out everything I can right now. 

I think I might be over Sidney.  I tried to kiss her again and failed, and it made me remember the frustrations I had had with the relationship last year.  Having thought about it at great length, I do not think it's really worth it honestly.  I just don't think we want the same things.  :/

It wasn't as hard as I thought though.  I imagined getting over her would be hard, but I really just stooped caring.  I still care a lot in the friendship sense and we are close, but romantically, I just don't find myself to be too interested.

Anyway I have to run to class and will write more later.

I am grateful for my living situation this year.</string>

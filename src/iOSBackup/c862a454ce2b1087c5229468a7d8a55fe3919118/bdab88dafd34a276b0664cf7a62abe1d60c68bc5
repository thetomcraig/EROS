	<string>Home, happy.

Well I have been home for about a week and a half, but only really been enjoying the summer for a couple of days.  I came home to a condo because we hadn’t moved into the new house yet.  Then when we did start moving in, I got the flu.  I got better just in time to begin work at JPL.  This is my first weekend and first real time to myself to relax.  I ran for the first time yesterday in the new neighborhood.  It was nice.  I like this neighborhood.  I miss South Pasadena, but it is nice here.

It’s been kind of hectic moving in and getting settled, there is still of course a lot to do, and it’s kind of stressful because of that, and I have been working on adjusting and thinking about my happiness and the like.

It’s hard to really figure out what’s best for myself because I know that going to school is totally counterproductive to my happiness and really just makes me unhappy all the time.  Having said that, I did do some good work last year trying to be more happy and less pessimistic all the time.  I think I will have a better time doing that this summer and hopefully feel better next year because of that work.  Really, I only have one year left at SB, so it does not matter to a certain extent.  But of course I can do a better job trying to be more positive and happy.

I have been thinking lately about happiness and pleasure.  I think the problem (or one of them at least) is that I have been confusing happiness with pleasure.  I have been thinking that one of the things that would make me more happy would be having more time to do things I want to do.  The truth is that this is not the case.  There is a correlation, but happiness I’ve found, and read, is really more of a long term thing.  It’s not about always doing relaxing things and not being stressed.  And it does have something to do with people and relationships like I have been lead to believe.  But as seems to be the case most of the time, I have been trying to come up with the perfect way to handle  all of this, imagining that there is some magical combination of activities that will click and suddenly make me happy.  Well it’s understandable to feel this way when I am forced to do shitty things all the time in school and have no options for what else I want to do.  And this is why I hate school so much.

Of course there are always options, and this is something I have also been working on - trying to figure out how little I should work.  I know it sounds weird, but I need to work less at school and figure out how to be happy with the time I have, and maximize it where I can.  This is hard.

Having said all that, yes, I do want to maximize pleasurable and enjoyable, relaxing things.  It’s hard for me though because I know I want to spend more time with people and work on my relationships, but whenever I have free time I feel like I want to spend it on my own because there is shit I want to do.  Yesterday for example I programmed most of the day, did some menial tasks I wanted to accomplish, and went running, then I watched TV with my dad.  And the was incredibly relaxing to me.  I feel like I want to spend all the time I have to myself and never really want to do anything with anyone else.  But now that I think about it, of course this isn’t true.  I do like seeing people and hanging out and all that kind of stuff.  But I think I really get stressed when I don’t want to do any of that but feel like I am obligated to, or I get tired of people after spending a certain amount of time with them.  It’s not like I am making the concours decision to feel this way, or that I am angry with any of these people, rather I just get burned out.  This is one of the reasons why I feel apprehensive about seeing people.  Thinking back on it, I suppose I have felt this way in the past, but it hasn’t been much of an issue until the last couple of years, when everything else in my life became so stressful.  And by everything else, I mean school.  I think I need to just limit these experiences, not like they are bad or anything like that, but I need to understand and accept that there is a certain amount of time I enjoy spending with people and that is okay.  I don think there is anything wrong with being relaxed when I am alone.  I think there is a lot of pressure to feel a certain way about acetone things, I think I should accept and work with my own attitude about how I wish to spend my time.

Concerning happiness and things on that front.  I have been somewhat concerned about the happiness I receive from material things and how stressful things make me that shouldn’t.  Here’s the thing, I have been condemning myself for finding happiness in material things.  But I am not really, I am finding pleasure in them.  If I like to buy new things and expensive things or I am exciting about getting something new in the mail, there shouldn’t be anything wrong with that.  Because pleasure is not the same as happiness.  This really does not mean that material poisonous fuel my happiness, but rather they provide me with pleasure.  So they are no replacement for people and relationships, but things are not necessarily evil either.  So I shouldn’t be upset with myself for this.  

Having said that I do want to focus more on the people in my life.  I am planning on seeing jack Sinclair today, and was apprehensive about it because I really want to program and felt like I shouldn’t feel this way.  But this is just how I feel.  Sometimes I want to see people more that be by myself and sometimes it’s the other way around.  But thinking about this makes me feel better, and I think I will see him, because programing does make me relaxed but I am trying not to worry about having tim to do everything, but rather, worry about feeling good about what I am doing.  And I know that spending time with friends will make me happy in the long run as well.

JPL job is going well also.  Kind of know what I am doing more than last year, so that’s cool.  Well see how that all goes.  

I am grateful for this journal, because it is one of the things that makes me happy.  I am going to write in here more (I promise!).</string>

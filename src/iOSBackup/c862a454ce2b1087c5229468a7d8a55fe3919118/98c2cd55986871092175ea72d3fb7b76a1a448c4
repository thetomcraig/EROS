	<string>I didn't do much Friday afternoon.  I was too exhausted.  Just surfed the web and played some minecraft.  Very unlike me.  The last week was pretty terrible though.  I'm feeling bit better about stress and shit, butI don't really know.  Paper and final to work on this weekend.  I slept in and feel pretty well rested.  Finished my paper, 1500 words in probably 5 hours.  Not too bad, and I might need to look over it, but I think it's pretty good.  Hopefully Ill be able to study for my final tonight; I'll spending most of the day studying it tomorrow.  I can't believe I have a final 3 weeks before any other final, pretty fucking annoying.

I got a text from that girl I met yesterday, Natalie.  She was flirting with me, smiley faces and lots of exclamation points.  I had to just keep it simple though, I didn't tell her I have a girlfriend, but I didn't really flirt back, and said I had to go.  I worried though, because I wanted to flirt with her.  She seems really cool and I feel like I shouldn't have those kinds of feeling if I am in a relationship.  Im not going to break up with Sidney and start dating this girl, it wouldn't work out and would be disastrous to the relationship I have with Sidney.  But it got me thinking about the relationship anyhow.  I don't think I'm really getting out of it what I want, but I'm also not sure what it is that I want.  I mean I'd like to have sex with her, but its more than that.  I guess I don't feel emotionally invested, or like she is.  I mean I really like and I know she really likes me. But it just seems very juvenile to me.  I feel like she's a girl, and not a woman and not because she's short or anything like that ( but tarts part of it).  She still refers to me as her "friend" and I know she is not going to tell her parents that she has a boyfriend.  

"Boyfriend" and "girlfriend" as terms are really important to me.  Id like to say I don't care about labels and I'm above them, but I'm really not.  I feel like she thinks of me a a friend who she really likes, not a boyfriend.  I know she's never been in a relationship, but I not know if she really thinks she is in one now.  I might bring this up, but I have to think about it a lot before I do.  I just don't know how happy she really makes me.  

To expound on later: last summer, last quarter, winter break, high school, last year, all seem to be in a category of "past" with no organization.  They float around in this nebulous space and I miss them all for different reason, even though I didnt love all of them.</string>

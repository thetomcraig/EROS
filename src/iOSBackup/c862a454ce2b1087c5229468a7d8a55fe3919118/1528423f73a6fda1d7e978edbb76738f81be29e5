	<string>Last week fairly hectic, had to make up for time lost going to holi. The last weekend. Not much better. Got all my work done but took forever, through no fault of my own. Midterm Wednesday, at least I have all of today and tomorrow to study. 

CS138 took 6 hours on Saturday and PSTAT took probably 8-9 hours last night. This shit is just so fucking tedious. The 138 homework I understand at least, but the stats is terrible. The subject is hard but the teacher and book make it worse by being so shitty. This week will most likely be tense as well, and this weekend is going to be concerned with study for two tests coming up next week, that's going to be a shitshow. I found a solutions manual for stats which will be beneficial, but not help me in the long run - concerning possible tests. Not mention that I'm allowed a calculator, but not the graphing kind like everyone already has. 

This quarter has been pretty good stress-wise. Only one annoyingly shitty class, GE is pretty easy, and not that many tests. But having only one midterm in a course is really worse in the long run because it is weighted so heavily.  Regardless, I'm not as stressed out this quarter, but it doesn't really mean I've made great strides and personal growth, it means my classes don't suck quite so bad. I've had shit to deal with every quarter and this quarter's shit it slightly less shitty. I can see that upper division classes can be less shitty, but I'm still awfully frustrated with this school. I will be hearing from schools I applied to transfer to in a couple of weeks. Whether I want to transfer is something I'll have to figure out after hearing where I get in. Fingers crossed. 

Things ok Sidney. We're pretty good but she does frustrate me at times. It gets annoying that she is so not a girlfriend, she doesn't really act were in a relationship at times and doesn't really act like a </string>

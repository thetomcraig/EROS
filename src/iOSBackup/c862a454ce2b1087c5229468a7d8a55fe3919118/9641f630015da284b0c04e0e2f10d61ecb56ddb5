	<string>Sidney still comes over to my room, to see just me.  I wonder if she would do that if it weren't for our past.  I definitely still look for her in the bro's room.  I feel close to her still and really wish I didn't.  Not that I want to feel apart, but that I don't want to think over her more or as better than my other friends.  Just because it's her.  And it's hard not being with her.  Anyway I suspect it'll be over soon enough.  I'm watching Solaris again to write about.  It's a good movie.  </string>

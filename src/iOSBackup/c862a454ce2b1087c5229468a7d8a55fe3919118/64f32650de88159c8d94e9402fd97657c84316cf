	<string>Morning.
I got balloons this morning - it as Glenn's birthday.  Glenn is my boss btw.  That was all well and good, had donuts too.

Went on a tour at JPL, worst tour I've ever been on.  They made us break into groups with strangers and attempt to visit a certain number of locations in a give amount of time.  Kind of dumb…  I was in a group with my coworker Matt Lewis, and two strangers, one of whom took total control and made us run all around when clearly nobody gave a shit.  Kind o annoying. I attempted to just be passive about the whole thing and not be bothered, with varying success…

I am going to make an iPhone app - for realizes.  I have looked into this before and ultimately failed, and I think it has to do with a few things - lacking experience, lack of interest, its too hawd.  With that in mind I am going to attempt to do this again, and the idea I have is something I really want, and have wanted for a long time.  An app that tells you what albums you don't have from artist you like.  With that in mind, I am join to break the project into what I think are manageable chunks.  The first of which is parson the iTunes Library XML file…  Here we go…

Have to go to bed.  Liking the kindle so that's nice.

Also I have been having some thoughts about Esther Du (other coworker).  Hmmmmm…

Also family stressed because house is welling soon!

Ok bed.  Good night, me.</string>

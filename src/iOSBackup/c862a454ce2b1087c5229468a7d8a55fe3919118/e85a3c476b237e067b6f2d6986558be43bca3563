	<string>Loss.

Home for the weekend, and glad for it.  There was shooting in IV friday night, and I feel pretty lucky that I came home.  I’ve been taking it easy and not doing too much work - all of my teachers have sent out emails about the shooting canceling and extending due dates for assignments.  So the good thing is that I can take it easy for the remaining weeks.  

It was a single guy who clearly had mental issues, and wanted to “seek revenge” or something along those lines, so he drove through IV and killed 6 people total.  I think I am bothered that I haven’t really felt anything about this situation.  

I looked up the names of the victims.  It seems like the guy’s three roommates, whom he killed, were all some sort of engineering majors.  I didn’t know any of them.  They could have been CC students, but it kind of got me thinking about life in general.  It’s so scary, that I could have known them, or that it could have been me.  But more importantly, what bothers me is the lack of feeling I experience.  Loss is loss, its just so weird to me that I can feel such sadness for a person whom I do know, and nothing for those whom I don’t.  It just doesn’t make sense that a person would do such a thing I guess.  

Theres a lot wrapped up in it.  But regardless I am going to bed.  I am grateful that I am safe and that everyone I know is safe as well.</string>

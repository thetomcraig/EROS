	<string>Keyed up/birthday.

I always seem to get bummed on my birthday.  I wasn’t really planning on doing much this weekend but on Saturday Sidney cam to visit and totally surprised me.  My parents arranged for her to stay, and on Sunday I was surprised again by a bunch of my friends who came to my house to see me.  This made me really happy - but since then I feel kind of keyed up.  I really don’t know why.  I mean I was panning on doing some programming this weekend and not seeing people so there’s that, but I think it goes beyond the classic “seeing people when I didn’t want to” deal with it.  I really don’t know.

Work was okay today.  My boss, Glenn, wasn’t in again today and I a ma little nervous about not really getting done what I should get done.  My coworker actually wished me a happy birthday and I thought that twas pretty nice.  So things are fine at JPL.  Could be better but are not terrible.  Truthfully I don’t know why I am so anxious.  I am incredibly relieved to be done with my summer class, and I didn’t do much today after work than a couple of tasks I’ve been meaning to complete.  This was neither good nor bad.  I really don’t know why but since Saturday I have been feeling incredibly nervous.  

It’s actually a physical discomfort that has been coming and going every couple of hours.  I know that it won’t last for a very long time (probably) but am still peeved to say the least.  

I really don’t know what it is…

Regardless I am very grateful for my friends and family who were thoughtful enough to surprise me this weekend.</string>

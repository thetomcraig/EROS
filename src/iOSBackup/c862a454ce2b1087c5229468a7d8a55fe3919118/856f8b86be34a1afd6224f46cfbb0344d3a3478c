	<string>Last Spring Break.

Going back tomorrow.  It was a pretty good spring break, I did a lot of reading and playing video games and watching TV, saw friends and worked on CS projects, mostly my own application, but a bit of work on the capstone project.

Kinda of depressed the lsat couple of days though, and I am not sure what to attribute it to.  I noticed this tendency for depression on myself for the whole break, I mean for the lsat year or two I have realized that I become really depressed when I have free time - not really a good alternative to how I feel when I am rally busy…  And this is what I experience last summer.  

The good thing about this break is that I have noticed that feeling there and been able to abate it, which i think is really a good thing that someone can do with depression…  At least I think so.  Obviously I would like to not feel this way, but I think i have to start somewhere, and I think being able to understand myself and what makes the depression apparent is important.

I don’t want to imply here that I have chronic, disabling depression.  I mean it is chronic, but it’s not as if I want to kill myself or do anything drastic.  If I look back on this later I want that to be apparent.  

Having said that, I think my school has fucked me up in the head.  I mean not deliberately, but I do maintain that UCSB has some glaring issues, and the undergraduate experience is not worth the money, like, at all.  But I think that the undergraduate CS experience has definitely made a stronger person out me and out of my peers, for me though I don’t this has really happened in the intended fashion.  UCSB has definitely made me into a fully-functioning adult, with a valuable and noteworthy skill set.  And I think the intent here was to challenge me and thus make me a stronger student, with a real ability to learn new things.  Well this did happen, it made me a stronger person and student, through frustration, and agony.  Not to do the actual experience a disservice, it was, and still is, a kind of hell.  Hell for me not just because I don’t care for academia, but because of the unnecessary pressures put on my by those in charge.  Really, its fucking bullshit.  Several of my professors were completely inept, and others gave us monumental assignments we could only finish by not doing work in other classes and cutting nearly everything else out of our lives except sleep and maybe the occasional meal.  Still other professors gave us assignments that would have been perfectly reasonable if we were not taking 3 other classes at the same time.

Honestly I’m jaded, and I was jaded when I came to UCSB.  I do not like academia, I do not like doing schoolwork, and I do not like being at a college.  I really do not like any of it.  There are a lot of things I do like, the people I’ve met, some of the professors/classes, the area, the beach.  I like a lot of things too, but this is often overshadowed by my immensely powerful negative inclination towards academia, and the shitty professors and classes an facilities at UCSB.

I mean, it could be worse sure, but for 30,000 dollars it could be a hell of a lot better.  

It’s taken over three years but I have a baseline of things that make me feel better - the most important and recent of which is meditation.  Meditation and exercise and mindfulness are the important ones.  Sleeping and eating well also.  I came into college pretty mature, and with a pretty good idea of who I was.  Being in college has really showed me that the person I was was not really sustainable, leading to the gradual changes I made.

I think a lot of my peers came into the program less mature, and gradually became more mature as they went along.  I really believe that most of my peers became more like me.  Go-getter, ahead of the game, kind of student.  So, good for them.  And really I envy them.  Maybe they aren’t happy, you can never be sure.  But I would like to have the feeling the UCSB turned me into a stronger person by challenging me and rally putting me into situations where I had to mature and build my character.  Yeah, that would be cool.  And this did happen in a way, but really it put me into situations wherein I felt depressed and anxious to the point of ill health.  

But I never stopped working.  And this helped me get by.  I have had to learn when to stop and when to give up and when to take a break and slow down.  So this is good, but really UCSB helped me do this by constantly making me feel like shit.  Maybe everyone didn’t always feel like this, but I did.  And I guess I should feel grateful in a way.  I feel as if in four years I accumulated the amount of stress some people feel in 10 or 20 years.  So perhaps this compacting of stress has led me to learn some things in my young adulthood that some people learn in midlife.  So that’s good, I guess.  

Some recognition would be nice, I have been getting A’s and B’s in all of my classes since day one, when my peers have been fucking up and learning things I already knew.  So it would be nice to have someone tell me that it was good of me to have been that person.  But it’s not even about that really, because I know this, and that’s enough.  I don’t want recognition, i just want to be happy.  And it’s nice to have a job, to have gotten one before anyone I know, and to know that I will be making a lot of money.  All of that is nice, as is the notion that I have learned some things from my school.  All of that is nice.  But really, I feel fucked up in the head.

When I as in high school I knew that I had trouble sitting still, trouble just relaxing.  I’ve had trouble with that for a long time.  I could hardly play video games or watch TV.  Now, it’s better, but at the same time worse.  I mean I can relax now, and I do relax more than I did then.  But at the same time I have gotten to used to doing so much work and being so stressed.  I feel that when I do not have anything to do that something is wrong.  That I should be doing something.  And this was how I felt in high school too.  But now this leads to high anxiety and depression pretty quickly.  And I think this has to do with how much work I was doing as well as how much stress I have accumulated over time.  I think I have exhausted some part of me.  Like I am burned out, even though I somehow can keep going.  

At this point I need to finish.  Need to finish need to finish, I keep saying it because it’s true.  I only have one more quarter left.  Even if I have become fucked up in the head, even if the school is making me ill and depressed it doesn’t really much matter at this point.  I only have three classes left - 10 weeks.  I have the job and the knowledge, all I have to do now is get out.

I mean I can’t really avoid thinking like this, and I am suffering from senioritis, but I can’t give up now, not when I am so close.  I can be healthy later.  I wish I didn’t feel that way about my health, and I am trying to improve my overall health was well as I can.  I think I really need to get the mentality down, the habits in place, and when I am done I can try to retrain my brain.

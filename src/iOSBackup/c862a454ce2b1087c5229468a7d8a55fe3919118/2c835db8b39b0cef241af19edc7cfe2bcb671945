	<string>Kind of a boring day yesterday.  Did a lot of stats homework, then Sidney and I ran at the same time and saw each other on the beach.  We got dinner toga her in IV.  Went to be early.  Got up today and looked at 138 a bit.  Ate and now I am waiting for Crystal.  Se should have been over here by now to work but has not responded.  I guess I will just look at some Philosophy until she actually shows up.

I am grateful that I can run on the beach and I feel better when I can do so.</string>

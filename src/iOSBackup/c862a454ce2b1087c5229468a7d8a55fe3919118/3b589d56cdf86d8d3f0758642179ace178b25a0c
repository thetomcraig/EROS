	<string>Pretty good

Weekend wasn't that bad. I was doing my cs 178 take home midterm for just about the entire time, but it wasn't that stressful. There is a difference between long and tedious and ambiguous and frustrating. The test was just long. But not hard. Here we are in week 10 as well. And what a nebulous quarter it has been. 

But anyhow, I think it's good to stop for a minute and take stock of the good things that are hell ing in my life. 

Went to a place called el wood with Sidney and Morey (dorm friend) and took pictures. It was a woody/hiking type place. Morey it's an amateur photographer and actually asked me to model for him. Which was kinda weird. But not that weird.  Anyway it was fun and Sidney and I are dinner in IV with some friends we don't get to see that often. Nick Clinton, Adam Sher. 

I'm going to an interview right now for a possible part time job writing python code which I think sounds really cool. 

Off to do that now. One more week then finals. I'm almost home!</string>

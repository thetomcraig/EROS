	<string>Home now, came back the night before yesterday.  Finally got all my stuff put away and everything.   I was sad to go from SB, and especially because I did not know if I was going to be coming back, which made it much harder to say good bye to everyone.  Especially Sidney.  Her birthday was on Monday, on Thursday I gave her two things for her birthday and for me going away; a staedtler eraser, and my watch.  I really wanted her to have something that belonged to me, I am glad I could give it to her.  She slept over the night before I left; we were both sad to say good bye to each other.  And we did so the night before; the day of was very hectic, and I just feel like whole year ends so abruptly.  I am still sad about all that, not knowing if I will ever see her or anyone of my friend again.  I feel like we were in a really good place, like better than ever before, before I left.  It felt like Sidney finally felt like she wanted to be in a relationship, and all that that entailed.  

She said herself that she just wanted a bit more time, and so did I.  When I was there I had no time for anything, and now I am back home with lots of time, and I feel lost.  Like I am going through the motions.  I just don't fee like I really want to do the things I was longing for time to do.  Well hey, work will start soon, and I am looking forward to that for sure.

My brother is pretty stressful, I wish he would just calm down.  I hung out with him and the Sinclairs las night and he got on my nerves.  I just wanted to be home and now that I am here, I feel a little lost.  The year just ended so quickly, and I am retry emotional about it.  

Got a buzz last night, glad to be free of the hair.  

Want to finish up "This Side of Paradise" soon.  

Almost done with the Pi.  Then on to the n64, whatever it will eventually be.  The only problem is that I am to ally broke.  Good thing I start work so soon!  But yeah, want to finish up those two projects this summer, and translate Hamurabi into Python, which won't take long and should be interesting.  And I think the remaining time I want to use for the Bots project.

Hopefully should finish Pi today.

Though I am feeling off, I am glad and grateful to be home with my family.</string>

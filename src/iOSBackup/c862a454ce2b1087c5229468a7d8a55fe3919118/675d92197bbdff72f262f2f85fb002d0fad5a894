	<string>Got drunk last night - I've been doing a lot of that lately.  Finished up reading Shakespeare and went to a party at Chris' house with Sidney and met up with Adam and Michael Ryan.  Sidney came back to my room and we made out, like a lot.  Like, a lot as an not what I would have expected from her.  She said that she was feeling distracted by me and that she actually wanted to kiss me now, because she kind of just did it before.  There isn't really a negative connotation to this and I must say I didn't really see it coming. She is falling for me it would seem. Though I don't want to be conceded. 

Not much homework this weekends. Going to try to get a lot of stuff out of the way so I won't be busy when I go home next weekend. 

Sidney and I are both kind of bummed that our friends don't spend as much time with us as they used to.  It's really a combination of things - the fact that were together, they live together, scheduling, extra curricular activities, and such.  But its really a bummer, I feel like I am slipping away from them year.  I don't know about next year, but I'm sure it'll be different.  I may be lonely no matter where I go, I'm really glad to have Sidney, and things are pretty good with us.  

When I think about last year, it seems like a short amount of time, but so much stuff has happened and it all seems so far away. He'll, even last quarter feels like another lifetime. 

Sidney and I are a bit concerns wit our friends, and drifting away from them. Something to think about, it's harder and harder spending time with them, and next year it'll be worse (if I stay here). And I've kind of forgotten about transferring, having a girlfriend makes me want to stay all the more. Still, I won't decide not to transfer just because of Sidney, that would not be wise. 

Valentines Day coming up, thinking of something cheesy and awesome. Gonna get all dem brownie points. </string>

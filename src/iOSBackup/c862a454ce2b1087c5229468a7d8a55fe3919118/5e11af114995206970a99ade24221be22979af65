	<string>Yeah, so I stopped trying to write in here every day.  Whatever.
Today was my last day at JPL, finished up a lot of things and feel pretty accomplished.  Now i finally have some time to devote to my projects.  I hope to get the iTunes one done before I go back to school.  As well as getting computer pile II up and running with some games. 

Not much going on in my life.  I got a text from Katya yesterday.  Just saying whats up, etc.  Which is strange because I haven't spoken to her in two years, and 'm pretty sure I broke her heart…  I honestly thought she hated me.  So that was strange, not sure if the conversation is over either.

Dad just came back from taking Jack to Louisiana for grad school.  So now I am finally free for a month before I go back to school, even though everyone is already gone…  But hey, jury duty is coming up!

I am going to see Mark Baker on Monday.

I guess thats most of the big stuff that has happened recently.

I am grateful for my job and my coworkers.</string>

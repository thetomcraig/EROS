The people who are buying our house came by and signed papers today. They seem nice, bummed they're taking our house though. 

Had Rylan over, played some minecraft and talked to him about school and shit. So that was nice. 

Ran 7 miles today, my dick purdy big. 

Did some programming, making good progress!  

So that's about it, not too bad a day. Still about concerns about myself though, maybe something to talk about with mark baker in a few weeks. Also I want to keep being aware! I've been pretty good lately. 

I am grateful for my house, and all the years I spent in it.   </string>

	<div><strong>Subject:</strong> Information on the Caltech-JPL Summer Bus</div>

	<div><br /></div>

	<div>Dear students,</div>

	<div><br /></div>

	<div>Thanks to all of you who filled out the survey regarding your anticipated</div>

	<div>Caltech-JPL summer transportation needs. Attached please find the</div>

	<div>Caltech-JPL Summer Bus schedule for June 19 - August 23.</div>

	<div><br /></div>

	<div>IMPORTANT: To use this bus you will need a bus pass (there is no charge).</div>

	<div>There are two different departure times from Caltech and pick up times from</div>

	<div>JPL. Only a certain number of passes will be distributed for each set of</div>

	<div>times. Bus passes will be randomly distributed at the SFP Check-in Fair,</div>

	<div>June 18, between 11:00 am - 3:30 pm, on the Center for Student Services lawn.</div>

	<div>If you find that the bus pass that you receive does not work for your</div>

	<div>schedule, you can trade with another student or you may need to identify</div>

	<div>alternative transportation. Information about the local bus route between</div>

	<div>Caltech and JPL is also noted on the attachment.</div>

	<div><br /></div>

	<div>Before boarding the bus on June 19th, you will need to show us your badging</div>

	<div>documentation (photo ID and proof of citizenship). For a list of acceptable</div>

	<div>documentation, please go to: <a href="http://www.sfp.caltech.edu/citizenship.html">http://www.sfp.caltech.edu/citizenship.html</a></div>

	<div><br /></div>

	<div>DRIVING TO JPL: On your first day let the guard at the security gate know</div>

	<div>that you are a summer student and that it is your first day. They will direct</div>

	<div>you to parking. Parking at JPL is free. If your first day is June 19th, you</div>

	<div>then need to report to von Karman Auditorium, which is located just next to</div>

	<div>the Visitor's Center, by 7:45 am. Be sure to bring your badging</div>

	<div>documentation. For a list of acceptable documentation, please go to:</div>

	<div>PARKING AT CALTECH: Permit parking is available on campus for summer</div>

	<div>students. A parking permit is required and will cost $95 for 10 weeks. A</div>

	<div>representative from the parking office will be present at the Check-In Fair</div>

	<div>on June 18 so that students can purchase parking permits then. On any other</div>

	<div>day you will need to visit the parking office. <a href="http://parking.caltech.edu/">http://parking.caltech.edu</a></div>

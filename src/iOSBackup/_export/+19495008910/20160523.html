<div id="127425" class="received"><div class="time">09:59:34</div><div class="text">Lifeline. The first one. Sequel is just the same thing. But the first one is really good. </div></div>

<div id="127435" class="received"><div class="time">17:26:05</div><div class="text">Because that's what people's keyboards look like.</div></div>
<div id="127440" class="received"><div class="time">17:28:23</div><div class="text">I just don't understand it. How do you know clean that?</div></div>
<div id="127448" class="received"><div class="time">17:40:21</div><div class="text">I know. </div></div>
<div id="127506" class="received"><div class="time">18:11:56</div><div class="text">We saw it!</div></div>
<div id="127508" class="received"><div class="time">18:12:27</div><div class="text">I know what you guys are saying about condos. I felt the same way when my parents downsized into one. </div></div>
<div id="127509" class="received"><div class="time">18:12:57</div><div class="text">In our case, however, we're expanding and make the beach house cooler. </div></div>
<div id="127511" class="received"><div class="time">18:13:29</div><div class="text">That's going to be the cool place we own that hopefully impresses people because that sadly means a lot to me. </div></div>
<div id="127513" class="received"><div class="time">18:14:37</div><div class="text">Big motivator here is just that we're not really into the ER scene. All these RVs with people living in them at the park depress me. Plus walking is now a big part of my life and there is only one walk to take here</div></div>
<div id="127518" class="received"><div class="time">18:18:15</div><div class="text">Prices are good in ER for some reason. We feel motivated to sell before the end of the year and before more homeless RVs are around. It's going to be a good while if we're lucky before this city makes some progress on that front </div></div>
<div id="127520" class="received"><div class="time">18:21:55</div><div class="text">It'll happen slowly, not as fast as Highland Park. I think this will be a better place in ten years, but in ten years we want to be living in Laguna and just bouncing back here for yoga and shit</div></div>

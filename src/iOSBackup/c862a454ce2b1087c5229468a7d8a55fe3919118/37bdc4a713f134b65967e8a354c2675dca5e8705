	<string>Time doesn’t fly.
 I have been home for just over a week.  Which seems weird because it feels a lot longer.  I have to go back in about 2 weeks :(.  But I have been doing some good programming and I jus started working on my JPL proposal for this coming summer.  That’s about it.  And playing pokemon. 

Really there is not much else going on, and its good.  I want to release my application at least in a beta version before I go back to school.  So until then I shall keep going hard in the paint.

I have discovered over the last couple of months that I really like the morning.  I think it is my favorite part of the day.  I’ve found that I am much happier if I can get up early and do some work (project, etc) and it make me feel better about the rest of the day.  And that’s what its really about isn’t it?  Finding the things that make you happy?  

I wonder if Sidney has told her parents about me.  It really bothers me that she hadn’t when last I saw her.  Aside form that though everything with her has been really good.  We have been sleeping together much more often and I can tell that she is much more comfortable with some of the physical parts of our relationship.  I really like that; it makes me really happy.  We have come a long way since last year when she was uncomfortable with kissing…  I feel like sex will eventually enter the equation, but I am alright that it has not become a conner stone quite yet.

I miss her, a lot.  My parents asked if she wanted to come visit, but for come reason I fee like she wouldn’t be interested.  But I want Isabel to come too, so I will wee if one or both of those can happen soon.

Things are pretty good, even considering my C and D from a few days ago…  It is interesting to me that time has NOT been flying even though I am doing what I want most - programming….

I am grateful for the break and my good health.</string>

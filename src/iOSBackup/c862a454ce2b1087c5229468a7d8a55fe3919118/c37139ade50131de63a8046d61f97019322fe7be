	<string>Project roller coaster.
I constantly feel like I am on a roller coaster with the emotions I feel from these classes, and I feel like I have gotten so beaten down I don’t really have the same intensity of emotion I used to have.

Finished the cs170 project finally, kept finding small bugs that we had to go back and change which was annoying - it makes me feel like were never done.  But at least I did okay in the midterm so I should be okay in the class.

I saw my therapist - Jeremy - yesterday and talked about some stuff.  I don’t really know what to feel about Sidney, I keep going back and fourth which I don’t like.  I feel like I want to break up at the end of the year because I know I do not want to try a long distance relationship, but at other times I feel like I don’t want to let her go…  I guess I’m all confused about it.

I felt pretty good about my conversations, and I had some good conversations with Sidney and other people.  We talked about art and I asked her about her classes and the like. - 4/5</string>

	<string>Getting back my sanity.

I am very prone to acting like a machine.  At the beginning of this year I was really happy and had made some changes emotionally, and for the first and second quarter I think that worked out really well for me.  This quarter though, I have two really stressful classes, AND I decided to pick up another job.  In combination with me paying less attention to my overall wellbeing, I really set myself up for failure.  And I have been really stressed lately.  

I put Day One in my calendar and have decide to write in tho journal every weekend, which I think is a good midline between every day and almost never.  

I also quit my second (programming) job.  I liked it, but I realized that it was really stressing me out because it was another obligation I had to stare at a compute screen.  The money was nice and my boss is a really good guy, and I liked how flexible I could be with my hours.  But honestly I didn’t have time for it.  I try to fit small things like reading and watching TV and working on projects into my life, and this job took that place of all those things.  Because I could be so flexible with my hours, it became something that filled the gaps and I felt like I wasn’t ever getting a break.  My boss was understanding, but I still fell shitty about it.  Just because I always feel shitty about that stuff.

But as is always the case, I have some resolutions to make.  The first of which is writing in here, and the second of which is giving myself more free time.  I’ve tried planning out every second of my life, and the opposite - let’s see what happens train, and neither of them seemed to work.  So I need some sort of midline.  

I am glad that I read every night, even if it is only for a few minutes.  I played video games recently with a friend and wish I had time to do that too.  So I think I’ll try to make time for that if I can.  Rather that trying to make time for every thing I want to do specifically, I think it might be better to have some times I that I know I won’t do work, and just fit things I want to do into those times.

So there are a few things I want to have time for - projects, TV, video games, exercising.  If I could run monday, wednesday, friday it would be great but my wednesday is totally shot because that’s when I do office hours to try completing all my stats homework.  So I usually run monday and friday, which i okay… I think I’ll focus on some other things before that.

Friday afternoon (for a few hours) Tuesday in the hour before my service center shift, Saturday and or Sunday morning.  Those are the time I want to start with and see how it goes for them.  I am putting them into my calendar, not as hard and fast prescheduled time that I need to happy, but as suggestions of times I might do relaxing things.  This is more of a suggestion of how often I think I should be relaxing.  I thinkI should be doing more of this, and as far as friends go, I think Sidney and I both are doing a good job making time for them, so I am not so worried about that.  

Lets see if I can’t be happy!
I am grateful for Sidney who helped me quit my job and for my parents as well.</string>

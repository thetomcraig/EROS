	<string>Home now.  Watched the end of Fringe, sad to see it go, even though it essentially ended last season.  Going to watch a bit more TV.  Worked on project also, and played some minecraft with Alfred and Jack before he left.  Did some cool stuff with the sever.  Health is just about 100%, so thats good too.  Selling a bunch of things on eBay, going to have a good amount of Paypal monies, and I bought and sent back another mouse.  Perfect one is out there!  Going to hopefully see Isabel, and might go in to see Glenn Ortonn before I go back.  Looking forward to the Perfectionism group when i do go back.  Also trying to learn how to touch type.  Not much else, getting all the sleep i missed ver lat quarter, spring break is never long enough!

Might need to eat lunch by myself when i return next quarter, I think I spent too much time with Sidneyâ€¦ </string>

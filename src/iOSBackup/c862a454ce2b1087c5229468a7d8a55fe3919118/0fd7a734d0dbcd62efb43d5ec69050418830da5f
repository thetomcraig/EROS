	<string>Yesterday was interesting.  I went to CAPS, the counseling service place - I'm going to meet with a counselor on Friday.  I almost had a panic attack yesterday, but I was honestly too tired to do so.  It's tough because I worked all weekend, and I'm still behind in all my work.  Conrad gave me more to do also, told me to write a few pages about the project I wrote about in my CCS letter, and turn it into CCS.  I have an immense amount of work to do by next Monday, and I was incredibly stressed yesterday.  I slept a lot lost night though, feeling a bit better now.

Regardless, I am tired of this shit, working hard and being behind on the shit I have to do, not to mention the stuff I just want to do.  I have to go, hopefully today will be a better day.</string>

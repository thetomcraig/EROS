	<string>A building at JPL, across from mine.  
Not much at work today, everyone one was tired and I was no exception.  Did some stuff, but I really have to wait until Glenn comes back so talk to him.  I can't believe it's only Tuesday!  These five day weeks are king to be killer!  But seriously, every other friday off is not that bad a deal.  I still like my job, and I feel like I am getting closer to my work friends.  Which is nice.  

I got a text from Kassia today, asking to hang out.  She has never done that before.  I suspect she must be really bored, because Alfred is at SD doing summer school stuff (I think) and she doesn't have a job.  I am a bit flattered, but would be more so if I were still in high school.  I used to like her when we were at Waverly together, now of course I've had had 2 girlfriends since then and I am still kind of hung up on Sidney.  Anyway it will be kind of nice to hang of Kassia, I like her.  

I am going to run in a bit, I am glad I have more time to do that and am doing it more often.  I was thinking today about that, and while it is hard to fit things into a day when I have a job, I still like it much more than school.  I can't stress this enough.  To me, reading this at school: Having a job will be better, power through college.

Speaking of which, I am looking into studying abroad… Japan!!  It could be a good opportunity, and there are a few programs that involve engineering stuff over there….  Anyway I am excited about that prospect.  Okay I have to run, but Going to keep up with this journal.</string>

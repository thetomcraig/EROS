	<string>Sadness/perfectionism. 
Or maybe just sadness. 

I have been feeling pretty good lately. Or at least, not sad. Things have been good with school, Sidney, emotionally, etc. 

I have been better about stress too. I have large assignments, but I am trusting myself to completely them on time, which I think is good. 

I got a Facebook account, and that has been interesting...

So yeah, overall things have been pretty good, as in not super stressful. I don't know though, things have been feeling very.... Empty lately. Like the release of stress has release all emotional attachment. I mentioned this before, and I think it's still true; I feel kind of empty indie because I do not have this magnified response to everything like I did last year.

I guess I feel that underneath it all I'm still the same, and I am just fooling myself when I say I'm not stressed. 

Sidney slept over last night, I tried to take some sort of step forward and failed, she said she just wasn't interested. Not interested in anything other than 2nd base, physically. 

This is frustrating to me because I feel like we were both going into this relationship with an open mind, and she has reneged on that sentiment. I felt the same way when I mentioned relationship status on Facebook, which she said she was NOT INTERESTED IN CHANGING.  she even said she would probably be deleting Facebook soon for the same reasons I chose to do so.  

Both of these things made me upset and everything seemed to pile on. It bothers me though, I mean, she hasn't even good her parents about us!  

I think I will talk to her about this when the opportunity arrives. I am trying to move slowly and work with her and I am feeling a little disrespected. 

Anyway, I am going to continue to feel sorry for myself in the meantime.

But I am grateful for my friend Isabel who makes me happy. </string>

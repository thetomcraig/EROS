	<string>Almost done with a few things…

Almost done with my JPL job, and almost done with being almost done with my app.  I guess I could think that I was almost done with my summer but that’s not true.  It may be true time-wise, but I am about to be free and my actual summer is about to begin.  For about a month I will not have to be in class or work a job and intend to use the time to finalize my app.  Which I have just about finished reworking from the ground up.  Not the best plan I think for something I haven’t released yet, because it’s longer time for m to hack away without a finished product under my belt.  Anyway it actually is close now and I think I’ll be able to finish it before the end of the summer and release it, then set my sights elsewhere, or work on it some more without feeling as pressured… Hopefully.  

I haven’t been feeling to hot recently.  I have been so focused on finishing this app that I have not yet finished that I just feel like I’m playing catch-up.  And I am really tressed because I don’t have a lot of direction at work and I am confused a lot of the time through no fault of my own.  I am working really hard to understand whats going on and implement things, but the fact of the matter is that my boss/mentor (Glenn Orton) is not making things very clear to me.  He is a classic scientist and not the best explainer.  It makes me feel pretty crappy honestly because I don’t get the best explanations and remain confused or worse, become mislead.  

It’s not the end of the world, I’ve spent a lot of time working on the best way to resolve these images I have, and I haven’t made a lot of output but I’ve made a lot of progress and produced a powerful software tool.  It doesn’t make me feel great though, because I just don’t feel like I am accomplishing what I am supposed to be.

I think this has a lot to do with what I have been feeling outside of work as well.  Like I am not doing enough with the app I want to finish, because I feel like I need to prove something with it.  I feel like a computer science person should be doing really awesome stuff in their free time that look impressive.  This is why I am so frustrated with my app.  It’s really not that impressive.  It’s a very simple way of displaying information about what’s playing in someone’s iTunes library on their mac, but it’s taken me over a year to make because of the various setbacks and shit I have had to do.  I want and feel like I need to finish the app because if I haven’t finished my first at least minority impressive venture then I am a failure.  At least that’s how my brain works.  This is why I am dead focused on finishing version 1 of the app.  

I suppose this also relates to the way I have been feeling about myself recently.  I have been struggling with being the right kind of person.  Of course there is no “right” kind of person, but to my mind there is aright kind of person for me to be.  And I suppose I am caught up in this whole “you are what you do” kind of thing, and I suppose I have circled back on the way I was feeling last summer before I talked to Mark Baker.  I have been struggling recently with wanting to be a well rounded, and pointy person.  In the sense that there are a lot of different thing I want to do with my time, and I have  been feeling like I want to make time for all of them to feel more fulfilled and like a more well rounded person.  At the same time I want to know more computer science and want to be the kind of person who knows a shitload about one kind of thing so I can feel good about dwarfing other people’s knowledge with my massive amount of knowledge.

What I have been realizing recently is that I am probably neither of these things.  I mean to a certain extent this is bullshit.  I don’t really think either of these things exist.  But I think I do feel crappy when I constantly feel like people know more than I do about things.  I think this is because I am so worried about others; approval that I feel like I need to know a lot to warrant others’ approval.  

I think what I should do is view this situation more constructively.  Other people know more than I do and I should treat conversing with them as an opportunity to learn more,so that next time I can maybe impart the same knowledge to someone else.  Yeah…

I have been thinking lately and come to this conclusion - I do not have the fastest processor or the biggest hard drive, but I have a lot of RAM.  I am not great at learning things the minute I hear them and remembering a shit ton, nor am I good at quickly making insightful connections and realizations.  I mean I can do these things, but I don’t think they are my strengths.  I think my greatest strength is dedication and patience.  I really want to figure shit out.  I will take the time to figure something out and I know a lot of people who don’t have that kind of dedication.  I have the ability to cram a shit ton of stuff into my head and regurgitate it shortly their afterwards.  This means that I am good at tests and academia.  Even though I hate it.  But I think it makes me a good computer scientist as well, because problems in computer science take for fucking ever to figure out, and as a whole, CS is incredibly tedious.  I know some smart kids who are not in CS at my school anymore, and I am still here, working my fucking ass off.  My school is not easy and I have gotten this far, with a 3.48 GPA thank you, and haven’t given up.  Even though I wanted to so many times. I know, deep down, despite what I think at any given time, that this is impressive.  Just as I know that building this app has taught me a good amount of Objective C and CS concepts, I know that finishing at UCSB will be impressive because of ho tedious and fucking annoying it was to go there and be a student.

I talked about some of this with a JPL coworker of mine on Friday (Dave).  He and I grabbed a beer in Old Town (because I can do that now!) and he had some interesting shit to say.  He’s 33 which is weird, I don’t feel like he is that much older than I am but he has done a lot of shit in his life, or so it seems.  Anyway, I’m glad I hung out with him because he is a pretty cool guy.

I felt kind of shitty this past week because I saw on Facebook that a former JPL coworker of mine is currently interning at Google.  Which I think would be really cool place for me to go.  And she is younger than me and seemed a lot less dedicated than I am.  I never considered Google because I honestly didn’t feel good enough.  So that made me feel kind of crappy.  

But I am interviewing this coming week at the operations lab at JPL, I think that would be a really cool place to work, and I would definitely want to work their next summer if I can.  Maybe I will try Google as well, to have more options.  

My plan of action is to have one more summer of interning to make moneys, then go to Japan.  I want to visit their first, and if I really like it over there as much as I think I will, I would want to go over there for an extended period of time and work in some capacity, maybe teaching english, and maybe doing something CS related.

A lot of the time I like to think that I should be doing more things ever day.  This is the easiest way I know to say that I really DO something and can thus think of myself as the kind of person who does that thing.  But I don’t think this is the answer.  At least not in some respects. 

I do read every day and meditate two times a day, but I would like to do more things.  Keeping to some sort of schedule is the only way I know how to be happy about doing things.  Its weird.  I suppose this isn’t really healthy though.  

What can I do differently?  I think, because I am this kind of obsessive person, what I can do differently is  do things every day that I think are healthy for me or at least make some sort of schedule that includes these things so I can feel good about that.

After talking to Dave on Friday I got to thinking about Computer Science and why I do it and why I like it.  Not everyone can do computer science so there is a sense of feeling special in this way.  It takes a lot of work and is tedious so accomplishing something in computer science makes me feel like I’ve done something not everyone has the ability to do as well.  Unlike things like art, if I set out to make something and the product I finish does the things I said it would do, I have succeeded.  You cannot dispute that I have done this thing that does its job well, and people know it was hard to make in the first place.  Because you can so easily and quickly create something an throw is away, there is a quick turnaround as well, and the act of coding plays off my perfectionism as well.  The more complex code becomes, the  more options there are for implementation, and the more directions there are to go.  Once you reach a certain level of complexity, code can be fixed over and over again and made better and better.  There is no end to it.  This is another reason why it is hard for me to every be satisfied.  And indeed I have been constantly refactoring the code and canning things and making them perfect that while the product has not changed drastically, the codebase has come leaps and bounds.  But nobody will understand this other than me.  Thus not helping the end game of me subconsciously needing approval from other people for the stuff I do.

I think one of the things I can do is create more goals for myself.  Checking things off of a to do list makes me feel good, so I think putting more things on a to do list will make me feel better.  I think this may be an aspect of cognitive therapy, which I may want to look into.

I want to make more habits of healthy things.  I think working on projects is important for me to feel accomplished, as is doing recreational things.  But I think that making habits of running and writing in here and meditating will make me a bit happier overall, so I will do that.  I think I will write in here every Sunday morning, and continue to meditate two times a day.  I think it would be cool to run every day, but that’s a loft goal.  I think I will county to walk and stand up more like I have been and run a few time a week.  I will start by I think running two times a week, and doing it when that’s most convenient.  So I am not tied to doing it on a certain day.  I also want to run more, shorter runs, so I can actually work them into my schedule.

Okay now that I have set those goals I should see if they are actually possible.  Because I set a lot of goals that I don’t reach and feel shitty about.  

Let’s start with running once a week and journal once a week.  That’s modest, and gives me time to work it in where I want to.  Then I will try to increase.  Yes this sounds good.

In CS I will also make a note of the things I work on and set more goals for myself.  I want to trick myself, and use my own obsessive behavior to create goals and tasks that I can adequately complete so I don’t feel shitty all the time.  So the current goal is completing this app, which I think is reasonable, then afterwards I will set specific goals that I can complete, and work my way up, slowly.  

I think this is good, and it makes me feel better thinking about it this way.

So now that I’ve said all of that, I want to meditate on what I’ve been thinking about in relation to all of this.  It’s hard.  It’s really hard.  Because really I’m not trying to just to be happy - everyone is doing that.  What I am trying to do is not be stressed all of the time.  But doing this stuff that I have been talking about to feel less stressed is extremely time and energy consuming.  Like I said last time, I lost the lottery.  I lost and I’m trying desperately to claw my way back up.  I suppose this is the way most of us feel about some sort of thing, whatever it may be.  But it’s hard, and this is what I wanted to talk to Mark Baker about.  About cognitive therapy and drugs - the two things I want to look into in terms of making things a bit better for myself.  

So what did I do last year that made me feel less stressed?  I think one of the things I did was felt long and hard about the way I was feeling at given moments, instead of being reactionary.  I remember that I talked with Mark about magnification.  I see things and feel like they must mean more than they do, or that they fit some narrative or have some greater meaning and ascribe more meaning to them than I should.  This I changed to some degree but paying attention to why I was feeling the way I was and what I was doing with that emotion.  This is what I want to do more.  This is important, and really, it’s all awareness.  Being aware of what is really going on around you as opposed to having it get torn up and thrown around in your head.  Examining the things that do this tearing up.  

I am grateful that I chose to seek out human contact.

	<string>Not lots of time to write, but a lot to say. I'll expand later. 
I thought I was going to have to break up with Sidney for good at the end of the year. I even told her so, and we both got really emotional about it. But now we decided to break up at the end of the year, but not permanently. Should I come back next year, there are no assumptions about what will happen between us. 

Still don't know if I will be here next year because of Vanderbilt, so I am going to day good he to everyone Thursday night should I not return. 

Took one final today for CS 64 and it was pretty good. Three more. Stressful as always, but not the word finals week ever. Difficult because I am so done with this year and can't wait to be home. 

Apple stuff announced today. I want iOS 7 really badly now, made studying for finals harder. 

Going to get a buzz when I get home. Way too much hair. 

Can't wait to go home for so many reason. Family, house, friends, job, projects, TV and video games. Everything. 

Did not get into CCS. Angry that they strung me along and were sucks about it, but don't really care anymore about not getting in. And I don't blame Conrad. Just feel condescend to really. But whatever don't car anymore. 

Sid eu slept over two night in a tow a few days ago. I really like her. A lot. If if aren't almost the end of the year, I think sex actually wouldn't e that far off. And maybe if I return, she'll want to have sex. But that's too far away to even think about now.  Though I did rub her vagina, and almost fingered her. Interesting I felt. She had more hair down there than I would have thought too... Anyway it was interesting, and felt pretty good, even on my end. 

It as her birthday today, didn't do anything. :/. But I do have something to give be Thursday night. I got her an eraser and my watch. Both symbolic I think and I think she will like that. 

That's mostly it. Studying and being stressed, waiting to go home, still confused about future plans. But excite nonetheless. 

I am happy that I can talk to my family about anything. I am happy Sidney helps me feel better when I am stressed. I am happy I am healthy. I am happy it's almost summer!</string>

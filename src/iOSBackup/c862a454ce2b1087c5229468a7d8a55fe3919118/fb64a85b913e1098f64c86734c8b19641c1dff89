	<string>Been in room since 10:30 studying for CS32.  I'm not even that stressed about it, just bored.  I had more to do than I bought I suppose, but last weekend was a waste, I spey it doing my essay which is very close to being done.  I'm going to stay up tonight as long as it takes to finish my study sheet.  I'll stare at it tomorrow and probably finish my paper when I'm bored of going over 32.  At least I'll e going home in a but a week now.  Test on Thursday, meaning I have Thursday night to finish my paper and I'll probably end up staying late then as well.  I think I'll definitely spend all of tomorrow studying 32 and Thursday morning going over it too.  That means I'll have a good amount of time THursday night to write.  I'll take a long time and stay up still, but it will be just enough.  Friday will be my day off and the weekend I'll begin studying for 40 and 5A, which I feel pretty good about.  I'm only really worried about 32, but I'll be done for tonight in a few hours I believe.  

Started work on new project.  Can't finish my GOLD script until my pass3, so I'm working on a Twitterbot.  I found some cool source code with is really complex, and I've read a bit about it, looks to be pretty annoying to set up what with the Twitter regulations to stop people from doing what I'm doing.  Rather than creating a bot that people follow I want to do the reverse; create a vast network of bots that communicate and gain followers in this community who don't know they're bots.  It'll be a lot of work and I can do it with mechanize, but I think I can find a good python Twitter module instead.</string>

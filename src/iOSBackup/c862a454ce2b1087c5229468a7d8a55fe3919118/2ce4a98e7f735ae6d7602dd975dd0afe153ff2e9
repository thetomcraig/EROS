	<string>Went to the Anderson's today as per usual.  Also finally uploaded all of my new music.  Got pretty tired of the whole Anderson thing, still sick in that sense - very lethargic.  Not much else today, mine craft and shit.  I plan to start working on a project tomorrow, though I know not which it will be.  Also looking forward to being able to run.  Tried to do some college research but the problem is that people rate professors highly for giving them the ability to skip lecture.  This makes the whole system unreliable for people like me who give a shit.  The plan now is to turn in some applications and decide after that.  It's just such a fuckfest.</string>

I have decided to take at least one picture a day and pst it in here.  Okay day, did some good work, met some of Esther's friends.  Got invited to a party Friday os we will see how that goes.  Caltech parties sound much better than ours, I was kind of bummed to here how much fun all of Esther's friends have had at Caltech.  

I thought about Esther today….  I think I really miss Sidney is all.  Or at least I miss some level of intimacy.  I don't know…

I am looking into studying abroad.  I would really like to o to Japan if possible.  We'll see.  

Listed a bunch of things on eBay, moving blows…

Still have to do a bit of programming, off to watch some TV.</string>

	<string>The search for the username continues.  I really like "tomwritescode" for a gmail and username but its a but long.  I'm thinking "tomviral" because its short, easy, and will never be taken because no other Tom has thought of it.  Been doing math all day.  Made chest sheet and revved determined coefficients  About to do variation of parameters.  
Conversation to remember:
Girl one: "Yeah then you stole her boyfriend"
Girl two:  "Yeah, I did.  It was easy too.  But I dumped him after a month.  And she should have known, he liked me the whole time."
Girl one:  "You WHORE."
These girls weren't even that attractive.

I can't wait to go home.  Two test which I'm actually not worried about, then Im out of here.  Going home friday, four days to go!</string>

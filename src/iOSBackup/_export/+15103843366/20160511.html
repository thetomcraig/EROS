<div id="125390" class="sent"><div class="time">17:47:23</div><div class="text">Kinda hectic. Trying to start a new project at work and getting one problem after another. </div></div>
<div id="125392" class="sent"><div class="time">17:47:51</div><div class="text">So that's it then - are you graduating this weekend also?</div></div>
<div id="125395" class="received"><div class="time">18:10:00</div><div class="text">Ah sounds stressful. What's the project?</div></div>
<div id="125396" class="received"><div class="time">18:10:11</div><div class="text">Haha yah it's kinda surreal, commencement is on Saturday!</div></div>
<div id="125401" class="sent"><div class="time">18:22:27</div><div class="text">It's not the most exciting of projects. Basically implementing some business rules into our software, but I'll be working with a friend for a change so at least there's that </div></div>
<div id="125402" class="sent"><div class="time">18:22:59</div><div class="text">Yeah it's definitely a weird feeling to graduate - I still don't feel like a real adult. Is your commencement going to be like 4 hours long like mine was?</div></div>
<div id="125466" class="received"><div class="time">19:25:55</div><div class="text">4 hours??? Did they read everyone's name out? I hope it's not that long, graduation ceremonies can be so boring </div></div>
<div id="125495" class="sent"><div class="time">19:50:38</div><div class="text">Oh yeah. They did several colleges at once. So my friends and I had to hear several hundred stranger's names... And it was like 90 something degrees </div></div>
<div id="125496" class="sent"><div class="time">19:51:20</div><div class="text">Anyway what are you doing on tinder during finals week?? Trying not to study? </div></div>

<div id="125502" class="received"><div class="time">19:54:09</div><div class="text">I feel like I already graduated </div></div>
<div id="125503" class="sent"><div class="time">19:55:15</div><div class="text">Yeah sounds about right. It's dumb that you take a final and then graduate a few days later. Who's going to able to study for that?</div></div>
<div id="125504" class="sent"><div class="time">19:55:26</div><div class="text">Especially if you already have a job </div></div>

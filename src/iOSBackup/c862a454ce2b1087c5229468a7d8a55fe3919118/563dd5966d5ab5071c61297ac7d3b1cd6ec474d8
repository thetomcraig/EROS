	<string>Taking the day off homework.  Had a midterm today and the weekend is going to suck so taking a break.  Thinking of going home for mothers day to surprise mom.  In an alright mood.  Wasn't able to finish the 138 test but i don't think anyone in the class did so its not so bad.  Did not get into Rice, should hear from other schools.  Making me scared - I don't think Im going to get into Brown now, but I suppose I should just wait..</string>

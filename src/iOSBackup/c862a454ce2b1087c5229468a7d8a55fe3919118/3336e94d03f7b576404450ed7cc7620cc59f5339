    If you are flying to the Pasadena/Los Angeles area, the nearest airports
    are Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Bob Hope/Burbank Airport
    (BUR), and Ontario International (ONT). LAX offers more flight options,
    but Burbank is closer and more convenient. Ontario is further from
    the campus than Burbank or LAX, but may be more convenient than LAX.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />
    To get to the Caltech campus from the airport: Caltech has negotiated
    a discounted rate with Prime Time Shuttle Service. Please use profile number <strong>272792</strong> to book your reservation.

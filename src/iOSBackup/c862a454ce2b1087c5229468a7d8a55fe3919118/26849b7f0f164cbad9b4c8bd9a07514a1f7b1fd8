	<string>Tiny bit of free time
Its the eye of the storm that always occurs in between large class projects.  I did a small project on my computer yesterday and this morning I went for a run in the first time for a very long time.  I am thinking about what Jeremy said about my relationship, and diverting more energy there.  Itâ€™s hard though, considering what I said previously about Sidney and me.  But I am still trying and I think trying is all I can do really.

Conversations were pretty good yesterday, I talked to Sidney more about art and tried to focus more on Mady when I spoke with her. Talked to Sidney about her art project and to Madison about some parties she went to and how she was proud of her self for not giving a shit about Morey. 4/5	</string>

	<string>Better.

So I’ve been into the Zen thing.  Trying to meditate everyday for around 15-30 minutes.  I also am going to go a group tomorrow at 7am and see if that is something I will want to continue.  

This has been making me feel better.  I am off the drugs I was taking and they really just made me depressed more than anything.  I am still a little depressed, but been feeling less overall anxiety since I started thinking about zen more and doing more meditation.  Also I have been doing a little yoga for most days of the week.

The quarter is going to get real pretty quick.  Lots of stuff to d with not much time, but I am feeling like I can do a better job managing it, which I think is good and a testament of my mediation practice.  I really think there is something to one of the things I read in the zen book I just finished: you don’t so zen because you want to, you do it because you feel like you have to.  And that is kind of the way I feel now.  But I am liking it so far.  

So classes are okay, two hard CS ones, and two bullshit ones.  At this point I really am feeling like I just need to get through it, but I do think I will like my capstone class, which is like an intern in industry kind of thing.  Not that I need tag for a job, but I think I will like it more than a stupidly hard class.

I am happy with the way I have been feeling.  Not to say that I am happy or not stressed, but I think that I have been doing a good job of trying to be more accepting, and understanding of what happens to me and who I am.

I am grateful for this.</string>

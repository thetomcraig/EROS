	<string>I've been getting kind of annoyed with people lately.  I think the break from Sidney means that I need more alone time again, even from her.  Now that I think of her as just a friend, I am getting tired of being around her so much.  I will have to delicately give myself more private time until the end of the quarter.  I just can't concentrate around her anymore.  Which is interesting because it is not because of any feelings for her.  Shutting off those feelings was actually easier than I thought it would be.  I'm just a bit fed up with all of her mannerism and shit.  IT"S ALWAYS SOMETHING.  

I wish I could have become friends with the girl Alex.  Not that I am interested in her, she just seems like a cool person.  I learned today that I have a class with her next quarter, so I think I will try to befriend her next quarter.  She did ask me my name towards the beginning of this quarter so I believe she was actually interested in me.  I'm not sure though, regardless she isn't quite cute enough for me to be really interested (shallow, I know, but its true).  I think I'll definitely talk to her next quarter, and befriend her.  I think I could use more more friends in general.  

I have come to HSSB to work and get shit done.  I've come to need more alone time.

I'm trying to get back into my rarity checks, and mindfulness.  Both are actually really hard.  </string>

	<string>More Cycles and the Pit of Uncertainty.

Just got back from a trip to Vacaville to see some college friends.  Very much the middle of nowhere and made me pretty grateful for the life I have here.  I can feel kind of lonely and like I don’t get out enough sometimes, but JESUS there are nothing to do there at all.

We went to see the Jelly Belly factory and that was about the most exciting thing in the area.  BUT thats beside the point really - it was really nice to see my college friends again and here what they had been up to in the ~6 months since we graduated.

Some had jobs they liked, some were still in school, some had jobs they didn’t like.  Overall I felt very lucky to be working somewhere I loved and living in a cool area.  I think it’s more normal to work a few jobs you really don’t like when you start working, before you find something you really like, so for that reason I felt pretty lucky.

I got a little burned out towards the end and didn’t like having to spend so much time inside a hotel room because of the rain, but I still had a really good time.

For the last ~5 months since I broke up with Sidney I have been going through cycles and trying to figure out how I feel.  The main 2 things I have been trying to disambiguate really are:
1. Was I unhappy towards the end of the relationship because there was something intrinsically wrong with the relationship? Or were there some (fixable) issues that were exacerbated by the school and stress and the overall situation I was in at the time?
2.  I am lonely right now because I really like being in a relationship and being a boyfriend?  Or do I really miss her?


As for 1., I have come to believe with time can be explained by the fact that I am a different person now that I was when I graduated.  I think that really there were some issues with the relationship, but overall the person I was and the situation I was in played a major part in how unhappy I was.  I hate school.  It was contrived and dumb and I think the person I was in school is really a more emotionally stunted version of the person I am now.

As for 2., I have been thinking about Sidney a lot, and in the past several weeks have come to believe that I do have feelings for her still.  I do really miss being in a relationship a lot, but I really do miss being in a relationship **with her**.  

I asked her to talk with me today after we got back from Vacaville and for the sake of brevity I will say that she and I were on the same page about how things ended in August.  She was definitely shocked at the time and we agreed it could have been handled better.  We talked a lot and discussed failings that we thought we both had in the relationship, which I am glad we did.

At the end we both agreed that we weren’t sure how to proceed.  I admitted that I still had feeling for her but was rediscount to jump into a relationship for fear that it would be like it was at the end of the school year and did not want us to revert.  I think we both have matured and become more independent and I am really proud of her for that.  I wouldn’t want to *undo* that in any way.

It was a bit different for her.  She said that in the beginning of course she was said and still had feelings, but in the course of becoming more dependent, wasn’t really sure if she still did have feeling for me.  If I wanted a YES or NO answer right now about getting together, it would have to be a NO, because she was still kind of muddled about it.  She also was trying to figure how she felt and what missing me really meant.  So she said she would have to think about it.  Not really that she would have a definite answer, but that she wasn’t ready to say YES or NO right now.

I think I am ready.  I do want to get back together with her I think.  But of course I would want to be careful and try to do it slowly, in a way that would not hamper our individual growth and maturing.  I wouldn’t want a college rehash.  

But she is clearly not ready for that.  Maybe she won’t ever be and needs to move on.  I think I need to be ready for that.  And although I hate the ambiguity of it, I am fine with just seeing how I feel and how she feels as time goes on.  

I am really glad I said something now though because I would hate to have waited and feel like I missed an opportunity. 

I think its good this way anyway, because for all I know I will feel differently as time goes by.  Even though I do miss her at times.

I will manage.  My plan lately has been to do more stuff and try to live life spend time with people.  In the hopes of meeting a lady.  So I think I will keep doing this.  I think it’s important to live my life and for Sidney to live her’s.  I think that would be the most important thing if we did get together anyway - I would want us to have our own lives to live.  

So I think for now we should live our lives and keep in touch and just see how we feel.

Not that any of that bullshit makes me feel better because I want to hold her again.  But I also know that it’s the right thing for both of us right now.  Either way I feel like we communicated well and will stay in close contact regardless.  

As I always say and hate to say: we’ll see.

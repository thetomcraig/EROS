	<string>Boring day really. I had some time to kill in the morning all to myself so that was nice. Classes meh. Got an 80.5 on cs 64, and I wish I had done better but really I ran out of time. Sidney did really poorly, also because she ran out of time. She took it pretty hard, and I tried to comfort her, but she didn't really seem to care. I guess I wish she'd have an opinion in that sort of thing. Affirms my belief that I need to break up with her at the end if the year even if I do stay.  

Did some gold research, classes don't look too terrible if I stay. Assuming I get what I want. Got my hdmi plugs for the pi in the mail. Should his barely fit, just have to solder and glue now.

Did stars until late. Started with Sidney and then waiting halfway through while she had to finish 32lab. Then she and back and finished. She was sniffling a bit and it just about drove me insane. Not a big thing but I could barely handle it. I think I just need more alone time. Never get enough. I feel like the end of the day should be a good opportunity for alone time, and when I don't get it it really drives me up the wall. I grow weary of having to do homework with other people all the time, but sometimes you have to. Next year fall quarter should be okay because I will only have to work with people for half of my classes, and only one person will be Sidney. Unless I have to ask for help for physics which I probably will. 

Writing 50 if I can. If not I might just take a fun class next quarter. That and physics 3, comp sci, and philosophy (for depth). 

This is all assuming I stay here, and in the college of engineering no less. Speaking of which! I have an appointment to talk to a CCS guy in Friday about my project, so I may finally get into CCS! 

Speaking of getting into things. I still do not know about Vanderbilt. They said this week probably, next week maybe. That's week 8/9 in the quarter. And I will have barely any time to decided between that and SB and Oxy if I get in. If I don't I have to think about Oxy. Still kind of appealing. I'm so fucking tired of waiting. I can't believe they're taking so god damned long.  I keep thinking about life in all possibilities and have to stop myself because I just don't know about Vanderbilt. And if I don't get in I'll be pretty bummed. 

At least tomorrow won't be so bad. Except it will have to look over my essay so I can go to office hours and ask about it and I have to finish stats homework and then Thursday have to get a jump on cs64 and cs138. At least the stats homework didn't take to god damned long. 

Also I'm fucking tired of being in everyone's face. I just want more alone time and never am able to get it. 

I don't like SEC I don't even know why I'm running it. I think I'll have to quit that even if I stay next year. </string>

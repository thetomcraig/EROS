	<string>Doing ok but kind of lonely.
Yeah, I didn’t really anticipate this problem to be honest.  I have always been good at making friends, and I maintain that I am, but usually this has been in the context of spending a lot of time with new people - like school or some group of some sort.  This is why I have been getting along with my coworkers.  I like them all a lot - very friendly and easy to get along with and ask for help - but I am not sure if I can really call any of them my *friends*.  Meaning I have 0 friends in Oakland.  Some in SF, but Madison is studying abroad, and Crystal is very busy, and Sidney is, Sidney.  So I really would like to make some new friends, but there is a threshold I haven’t over come.  If I had just one friend I could easily leverage that into making more (I think), but insofar as they impact my weekly activities, I have 0.  Which is a bummer.  

Compacted with this is how much I miss being in a relationship.  Maybe this is exacerbated by my lack of any relationships, but I have found myself really missing being in a romantic relationship.  I think I am just much more comfortable being in one, which I had not really expected to be the case.  But the 0 friends thing makes it harder to go out and meet anyone, let alone women.  I have become more comfortable being alone, but not enough so to go to a bar or anything like that.

So I turned to what I thought I never would - Tinder.  And I thought it seemed pretty cool for all of 12 hours.  But it’s kind of shitty.  I have talked to several spam bots and not much else.  I am extremely picky (this much I knew) so I only like a fraction of the people on the app, and unfortunately, most of the users seem really immature and superficial.  God I feel old.  I also started using “Coffee Meets Bagel”  Which seems to be the more adult and sophisticated version of the same thing.  Next time I write I will hopefully have something to say on this front.

Needles to say I am pretty god damned bored - but I really can’t complain about being a little bit bored when I have a 6 figure job that I don’t have to show up to until 9:30 and can take every Friday off. 

So yeah, quit bitching, me, life is pretty damned good.</string>

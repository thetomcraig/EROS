	<string>Back at home for the weekend.  
It is restful, which is nice.  Been talking to dad about meditation and stuff like that, and getting steps.  

I have noticed that I have been less stressed over all, and I think that meditation and mindfulness have been doing a lot for me.  I have been going to a zazen group in the mornings in IV and I this has been good for me as well.

Classes aren’t actually that bad, and this is partly because the shit hasn’t hit the fan yet.  I still want to get out of this school but slowly but surely I have been feeling better I think.  The medication I tried last quarter didn’t really do it for me, and I have found the zen meditation to be helping me more, which I think is good.

Sidney and I are still good and honestly aside from how much I hate some things about my school, things have been going pretty well.

I am so grateful for my family and all of the good things in my life.</string>

	<string>I finally got my paper work done for transferring colleges.  I'm also done with the CCS stuff finally, or so I like to believe.  I had to run around to multiple offices today.  I wanted to sign up for the perfectionist group offered by the counseling place, but i tried and got an emil back saying they are full.  Eh.

I met a girl today at the SRB who is also applying to transfer various places.  I talked to her for a bit and then exchanged numbers.  I feel kind of guilty about this, not that I did anything wrong, but I feel like I should have said something about how I am in a relationship.  I think part of the problem is that my relationship doesn't really feel like one.  I mean I really like Sidney, but there things I wish were different, and I don't know if that is really something I should be concerned about or if it just that I've been spending too much time with her.  I get tired of anyone when I spend too much time with them, and this was true of several people last year.  I don't know, I am going to have to start getting more alone time, and I suppose this will help me be less annoyed.  

There are still things that bug me though.  I wish she was more of a girl.  She doesn't dress or act like a girl really, and if I could put it in words Id say that she is a girl and not a woman.  I don't feel like the relationship is a real one, also because I know I probably won't ever have sex with her.  And that is something I want to be able to do with my girlfriend.  I worry, because I was attracted to this other girl.  Not physically, but I liked the idea of hanging out with her.  I mean I don't think I would really want to g out with her, especially if it meant breaking up with Sidney, but it is kind of representative of what my relationship is like right now.  

I think I just need time.  In a month or so I should hear back form colleges, then it won't really matter if I choose to transfer.  Bust honestly I don know whats next, but I hope I can get out of here.  Its just so god damned frustrating and being an engineering student is so impossibly hard all the time.</string>

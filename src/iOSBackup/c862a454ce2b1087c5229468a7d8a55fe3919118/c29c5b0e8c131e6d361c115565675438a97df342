Well Sidney came and went, and I have moved all my stuff - the movers had to come early, so I am without my stuff until the 1st.  

It was nice to see Sidney and I had a nice time with her - I am afraid though, because I don’t want to do a long distance relationship thing.  I know she gets that, but I am still concerned.  The original plan was to break up after graduation, and then we decided to break up at the end of summer.  She just recently interviewed with a company in San Fransisco that is probably going to give her an offer, and she won’t live too far from me.  We also talked about her visiting me in Oakland.  I do hope she gets to work in San Francisco and I do want her to visit me in Oakland, but I am worried that there won’t be enough time in between our visits, and it will feel like we never went our separate ways at all.  I feel like we are going to be put into a position in which she doesn’t see any need for us to break up at all because we are living so close to each other and all that.

I almost wish we had not seen each other this summer, and we had spent more time apart.  We had sex when she visited.  I mean how could I not?  But I can’t help but think she will want to stay together.  I mean I know she doesn’t want us to break up, and I feel that if she star working in the Bay Area, then “going our separate ways” won’t really make sense anymore.  The problem is that I want to break up.  To be brutally honest I am tired of her.  And I think that is okay.  I really do want to keep in touch with her, and I know that it will be possible, but I am just worried that she will see this as a sign of me not wanting to end things.  I do though, I just wish there was a better reason for me to come up with.

But I am tired of her.  And I don’t think thats a bad thing really, I think she is too much like me to keep a serious relationship with.  A lot of the issues that I have and stuff I have been working on I see in her.  And it is really tiring for me to constantly be her therapist.  I see her doing things that I have been trying to avoid, and when she puts stress on herself it really easily bleeds onto me.  I see a lot of myself in her and I feel that I have implicitly become this cure for her.  Like all she has to do is unload her stress onto me and I can always fix it.  I guess I’m tired of this.  I want the kind of person who is less like me I guess - someone different.  

There are other things that bother me to - I am annoying at how unabashedly non-feminine she is.  I have been thinking about this stuff as superficial, but I think that it shouldn’t be too much ask.  I like women, who are women.  I think Sidney is an amazing person, but it does get to me that she is not girly at all.

I guess that now there isn’t much to do other than wait and cross that bridge when I come to it.  I just wish that I wasn’t so sure what was coming.  I wish there was some way I could prepare.

Also, all my stuff is gone.  The movers took it away on Monday and I will be getting moved in this coming Saturday.  I am pretty excited about having my own place for once.  Not much more to say about that, really.

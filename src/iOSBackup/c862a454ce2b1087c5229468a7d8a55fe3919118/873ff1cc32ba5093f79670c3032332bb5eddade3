	<string>It’s over.

Well I graduated a few days ago.  I can’t believe it’s over really, it’s kind of unreal.  I think that sometime in the next couple of weeks it will really hit me.

I am going to finish a piece of writing soon discussing how I felt about college.  But in a word, it kind of sucked.  I mean I just did not really enjoy the whole thing.  There was a bunch of stuff I did like, but this really was overshadowed by the shit I did not enjoy.  

I expected to be really stressed now, because I have been having issues with stress recently in the absence of “work”.  But I have actually been feeing fine for thefts couple of days, and I think keeping myself busy and meditating help with that.  

I have seen Rylan an Jack Sinclair and will be seeing Isabel in a  few days, I am quite a bit of time to relax and work on some projects I have been wanting to get to, as well as find a place to live.

I am not sure how to feel about Sidney.  I started feeling kind of annoyed with her, because of how stressed she was.  I feel like it reminded me of ow much stress I have, and because I was trying to manage my own stress, having her stress pushed on me made me feel kind of used.

I am not sure if this feeling is warranted though.  I can’t tell if I am feeling this way because I am too sensitive or if she really did put too much of her stress on to me.  It kind of makes me depressed, but this made me feel kind of apathetic about the relationship towards the end.  I felt that she was really affected by not having me in her life and I did not feel the same way.  

I think that in a little while I will feel the same way, that perhaps I am just feeling this way right now because we saw so much of each other.  But to be honest I do not know what I should do.

I know friends who have maintained their relationships, but I do not know if that is a good idea - even if she is in the bay area and it is feasible.  I guess I am just scared of trying to maintain a relationship and keep it the way it was during college, preventing myself from have new experiences.

But if I am being really honest with myself, I think I am just tired of Sidney.  I said that I loved her last summer, and meant it, but lately I have been questioning that.</string>

	<string>Woke up sick, went to breakfast and then slept late. Not that bad a day actually. Finished hamlet and wrote my response. Tomorrow will finish up comp sci stuff. Weekend will be shit, but I'm almost done!  Had a good time reading with Sidney today. Played the compliment game, like I did with Katya. Only it was more interesting this time. Hopefully Sidney can sleep over again this weekend. 

Lunch was awesome. Japanese theme and all the food was great. The rest of the week might not be great but at least today and yesterday make up for some of the shitty weekends I've been having. Kinda. </string>

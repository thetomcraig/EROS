	<string>Well somehow I got 9/10 on my math midterm. This replaces my 3/6 grade. So I pulled myself out of the depths of failing math 5A. At least for now. I van hardly be pleased though because I studied for four days straight and one question I got right from a guess. This test like that last, was multiple choice. Have you ever heard of such a thing? Multiple choice math is the most reductions thing I've ever seen in academia. The first test would have been fine if I had not made a few small mistakes. I studied for days for that one and failed it! I think I will at least pass his class but its utter bullshit. I feel for Sidney who got 4/10.  And its not even her fault; she would have been done fine if she hadn't had to put math on the back burner because of her CS24 class.  THat's exact situation I narrowly avoided last quarter and this one too.  But I wonder, when will that happen to me?  When will I have so much work to do that I literally cannot possibly give it anymore and I fail anyway?  Maybe not this quarter, but it's bound to happen.  And it's not even a question of scheduling.  You have to take what you have to take, when they tell you.  I could fill pages with my frustration with this school right now, but it wouldn't accomplish anything, and I have other things to address.  For now I will put my head down and work until Winter break, wherein I will seriously look into transferring.

I cannot believe I have had this thing going for under 12 hours and I have tons of material to write about.  Because I don't want to forget.  I look back at last year and wonder how it was.  We tend to remember only the most memorable, and enjoyable things.  I think I actually didn't enjoy last year in many respects and I want to look back at this year and be able to make decisions for future events based on these events.



The next topic is Sidney.  So that I don't forget - we were "together" for about one month.  Together being in quotes because of the nebulous state of the affair.  We liked each other and took things to the "more that friends" stage, but not very far.  She never got used kissing, or anything really, that was not simply holding hands - privately.  So that I don't read this and think that I am an asshole: I was very patient.  Seriously, VERY patient.  But I came to realize, as she did, that there is a difference between moving slowly and not moving at all.  And our relationship (if you could call it that at all, because I probably won't, even to myself) seemed to borrow more from the latter.  And so I made the decision to cut it off.  And she realized that it was the right thing to do.  Because it was torture to me, not being able to hold her hand in public or tell anyone about us, or anything else really.  And it's very frustrating - because I still like her, and she still likes me, and I just think it's so absurd that two people who are so good for each other and to be apart.  And I spend all day with her, and I really like her, but I have to distance myself, emotionally.  I am reminded of "Every Day I love You Less and Less" because I can feel it - every day I do like her less.  And I have to remain her friend because she is just such a good friend and person and she really is like me in many ways.  I honestly understand a lot of her anxieties and fears, or at least I feel like I do.  But I have to stop thinking about her in any way that is not just platonic, because if I don't I'll go insane.  And I just have to be a nice guy - that's what it's all about right?  As Isabel and I know, being a nice guy is one of the hardest things in life.  And I know she still likes me, I can feel it, and I can see it in her eyes sometimes.  But I can't fall into that trap of hopefulness, if I do I will never be happy with her.  So I remain the nicest guy ever.  I know I worry about being a nice guy, but seriously I know that I am.  I have had to do the right thing several times, even when it was immensely difficult.



Adrian is another can of worms I don't really want to delve into now, but he is now more often mopey Adrian than normal Adrian.  I basically have come to the conclusion that I don't like him that much.  If I didn't have to spend time with him because of academics, I don't think I would.  So we will play it by ear and see.  I get the feeling we are both pretending to like each other more than we actually do.  I sort of hope we will drift apart.  A sad thought, but I guess it will determined by next quarter.

Do I feel bad about not hanging with Adrian? No. Why torture myself?


I'm getting a bit tired if Sidney. Not because it's her but because I spend all day with her and I'd get sick of anyone in such a circumstance. I suppose next quarter will be better. But I've told myself that FOR EVERY QUARTER. And each has been word than the last. I look forward to next quarter because its a change. The scheduling is good, but I think it'll be pretty dull. 


So that I don't have any allusion looking back on this: I'm not really to happy with this school. Similar to the way I felt in high school but for vastly different reasons. I can hope next year is better. But I thought that of college in general. So what can I believe?


Also. Who the fuck just tries to open your door (Adrian). 


Doing things every day really is the best way to accomplish them. Do it Tom. 


I'm beginning to get pretty annoyed with Sidney.  And I know that its just because I'm with her so much.  Many I can't wait for break.  It's always some drama.

	<string>Pretty damn good night.  Got shwasted last night.  Went to Kevin's house with Adam to talk about robots, did do, then many drinks follow thereafter.  Came back and apparently danced for Scott, who took pictures.  May have thrown up a tiny bit, but had a god time.  Woke up a bit hungover, breakfast with Sid, and math class.  Talked to guy from my writing class.  Did some comp sic and met with CS48 group, then a bit more comp sic.  I told Josh, Adam, and Scott about Sidney and me, and they predictably joked about it.  Watched some Superbad, had some coffee and tea.  Finished Merchant of Venice with Sidney, and talked robots with Adam.  Did some coding and worked on CS project.  Need to finish the Stand!!  Ditched the CS10 (ccs) class I was going to sit in on.  Got a good amount of work done.  I kissed Sidney twice today, once in the morning and once at night.  I can tell now, when she wants to, and I have to say it is in fact more often than last time.  I was worried about wanting more from this relationship than she was ready for, but I am no longer worried about that.  I watched a movie - Perfume - with her on my bed and I held her afterwards, honestly I have enough now.  I have a couple more people to tell about us and I might want to kiss her a but more often, but aside from that I am happy with the relationship as it stands now.  She makes me really happy, and I do her.  I may not feel this way forever, but right now, I am happy.  There is always more shit to worry about, but she makes me happy and I really like her.  

Going through with applying to CCS, going to essay this weekend.  Overall it was a good day (didn't even have to use my AK) and I wish more days were like this.  Just have to get shit done, drink coffee and spend time with my girlfriend.  If that everything were so easy.  More, but not for now.</string>

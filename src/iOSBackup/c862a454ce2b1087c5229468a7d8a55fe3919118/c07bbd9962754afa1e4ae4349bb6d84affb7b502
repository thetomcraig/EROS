	<string>Pok√©dex. Can't give this away. 
Not the best work day. I mean it was fine. Didn't get much done though and had issues with programs.  My computer at work is fucking slow and exacerbates any issues I have. 

But overall not a bad day. Clews up up some stuff for showing the house, and forgot to program... But missing a day is no big deal. I ran which was good - I'm going to try to do 3 days a week. 

I am worried about y happiness as peer yesterday's entry. Thinking of going to a therapist. Hm...

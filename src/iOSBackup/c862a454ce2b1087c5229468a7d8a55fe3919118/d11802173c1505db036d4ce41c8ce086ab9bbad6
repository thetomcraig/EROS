	<string>Deeper into summer.
I am doing well.  Keeping busy with my projects, which no are django stuff and Japanese practice.  It’s really nice to have this time.

My mom and I came back form Oakland about a week and a half ago and I did find an apartment - which I am really excited about.  It was not my number one place, but the housing market right now is insane - lots of competition for apartments and the like.  It is right on Lake Merritt - so I can’t really complain that much about location - its even walking distance from work as well.

While we were there I got to meet my team members as well, and they all seem really nice, so I am legitimately excited to move and get underway.  I am really glad I got this break and surprisingly, I am not as anxious as I thought I would be.

Met Alfred’s girlfriend yesterday - and spent 14 hours with with those friends.  It was interesting for me - I predicted that that much time would wear me out and it totally did.  I just can’t handle that much time with people, and I am okay with that.  I think a lot of the work I can do to be more happy is related to accepting my flaws and not trying to change or improve everything about myself.  I mean I think that there is a lot of improvement I can do, but I think I shouldn’t feel like I have to change everything all the time.  

I wish I missed Sidney  - kind of at least.	I know that she misses me, but I just don’t really miss her.  I do like I do all of my friends, but I don’t really miss the relationship.  I think that I do not tend to miss people much, because I am fairly self-sufficient, but I think part of it is that I kind of got tired of her.  Which of course, I feel terrible saying, but the whole thing for me just got kind of tiring.  I just got tired of hearing the same stuff from her and dealing with her stress.  I think that as she opened up to me, she held everything back less.  And I kept hearing the same anxiety related stuff over and over.  Which of course I could relate to, but I kept seeing her cause these problems for herself.  I don’t know, I am not sure how to feel about it.  I think that getting tired of it is okay, and I feel that for the last couple of months leading up to graduation, I pretended that I wasn’t tired of it for her sake, because I knew that everything was going to end soon anyway.  And in retrospect - good job?  I don’t know if it was the right thing to do really.  I know that if this happened a million more times in a million different ways I would probably do the same thing though.  Because that is the kind of person I am.  

I will probably always feel shitty about this.  And maybe I am doing the wrong thing by inviting her to visit me.  But I rationalize with several things:
1. I want to have sex again
2. I do miss her - just not in an unbearable loving kind of way

And I think that is okay.  Kind of.  Ill probably think about it a lot more.

Also I have decided that I do not need to finish my piece of writing about college.  It is just about complete, and unfortunately, any editing I could do now would server the purpose of making it sound nicer and less offensive.  I just don’t really want to think about college any more, so I a going to record it in this journal, to look back on, but I am no longer interested in doing any kind of publishing of it.

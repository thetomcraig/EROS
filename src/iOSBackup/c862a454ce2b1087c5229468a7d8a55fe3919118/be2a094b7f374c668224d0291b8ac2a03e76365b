	<string>Drugs?

So I’ve been taking this drug for a couple of weeks - Lexapro.  It’s an SSRI, which is used for depression and anxiety.  It hasn’t helped yet, but it can take up to 6 weeks apparently.  I am also  doing some yoga and going to therapy.  I am going to start going to a mediation group this coming week as well.  I was very stressed over the summer and over the last couple of weeks and the anxiety lead to depression which lead to general apathy.  Which is kind of how I feel now.  I feel slightly better than I have been in the last week or two just because I have been doing stuff and being active.  So I’ve been distracted from the crappy feelings.  But I have also been doing some enjoyable things like seeing friends and stuff.

Sidney and I have been doing well.  We have started having sex.  Which I thought might never happen.  But it has.  I need to work on taking longer to come so she can get off.  But this isn’t as big a deal because out communication has been really good.  I still get worried because when one of us is not feeling very good, stressed or whatever, then the other seems to get affected by it, which sucks.  But I think we have also been doing a good job of spending time on our own and that kind of thing.  

I am in the process of interviewing with Pandora and over the next couple of days I am going to see if I can apply to some other places as well.

Work as ResNet on campus is going well also, I like being able to walk and drive around and do stuff.  

Really things are going pretty well, I shouldn’t be as anxious as I am.  And lately I have been feeling the perfectionists feelings.  It’s like the minute things are not really stressful I get a chance to worry about how they aren’t perfect.  And if I have nothing to do, then I just freak the fuck out because I feel like I should be getting a lot done.  And I am so tired of having so many thoughts, whatever they are about specifically, that I am just kind of depressed.

But I am trying, I have not given up.  I am trying to care less about what I am doing and just take things the way they are, and do more restful things.  Restful things I actually can become distressed doing.

This is all very hard, but I am working on it.

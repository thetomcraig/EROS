Intro
I have been thinking about writing something about my college experience for some time, but in the last couple of weeks it has become more apparent to me that I need to write something. 

On June 13th I graduated from the UCSB’s College of Engineering with a degree in Computer Science.  The last four years of my life have been transformative to say the least, and I am writing this piece to share my experience with others, and as a way to fully capture the person I am now, so I can look back this period my life and get a feel for the kind of person I was at this time.

Before I start, let me say what this piece is NOT.   
	This is not meant to convince anyone of anything.  It is a record of my experiences and opinions, and if they don’t hold true with your views, that’s perfectly fine, to each his own.
	This is not a piece hate mail for UCSB.  I need to say this now, because you might not believe me if I say it later.  I think I might be kind of jaded by my college experience, and I have some negative things to say, but they are not the main purpose of this piece.

This piece will chronicle my time at UCSB, broken down by year.


Year Zero
There is a year zero section because I have to give some background on my life before college.  And because Computer Scientists have to start counting at zero.  Always.  Unless you’re in MatLab.  But in that case you might have to evaluate your life choices.

I went to a small high school in Pasadena, California.  Pasadena was described by a friend of mine as “Anywhere USA”, and it really is, and that’s one of the things I like about it.  When I say I went to a small high school, I don’t mean “charter school small”, or “gym teacher is the math teacher small”, I mean 120 students.  My graduating class was 28 students, and that was a BIG class.  We called our teachers by their first names, and it was so small that the jocks were the stoners.  It was almost impossible to have “popular” kids because there weren’t enough other kids to look up to them.  I think I was probably in the “nerd” group in some capacity, but this doesn’t really matter.  What matters is that it was very small.

I did enjoy my high school and I think it was a good place for me at the time.  One of the downsides of this, is that I was pretty sheltered, and honestly did not face too much adversity.  Going to a school with only about a hundred students gave me about 0 preparation for attending a university with a student body well over 20,000.  I still find myself sometimes amazed at how many people I am surrounded by who are complete strangers.

I got all A’s in high school (except for a B+ in Spanish II, which we won’t talk about) because I studied.  Like, a lot. Every day.  Really, I have had a lot of anxiety for my entire life and in high school I was so afraid of failing my classes, and doing poorly, that I became an academic perfectionist.  Because I had time to do homework all day, I did.

This was not altogether invisible to me at the time either, and I knew that college would probably be more academically challenging than high school.  For this reason I wanted to learn how to manage my time better.

This is why I went to see a therapist for the first time the summer after graduating high school, in the hopes of learning how to be more well adjusted for my college career.  I met with him several times and he helped me come up with some ways to manage my time better in college.

Year One
This failed.

My freshmen year was hard, and challenged me in a bunch of good ways.  Classes were tough, people were different, lots of stuff was happening.  The academics were challenging in ways I had not envisioned.  Unfortunately, rigor and difficulty were not even half the issues I faced.

And before I talk about anything negative, I met a ton of intelligent and smart people, had some really eye opening experiences, and learned a hell of a lot of computer science.  This was the first time in my life that I was spending time with kids who also liked to take computers apart and learn how to program, and I have met some people in college who I know I want to maintain contact with for the rest of my life.

There were a lot of things bugging me at this time in my life, primarily the bureaucracy of my university.  I could not understand how they were housing three students in rooms clearly built for two, how my teachers were clearly ineffectual and not interested in teaching, how finding a quiet place to work was next to impossible on campus.  Just signing up for classes was a pain, and finding a place to sit in lecture was sometimes impossible.

It was clear to me that the university had admitted too many students as a way of coping with budgetary issues, and this meant there were not enough resources available for the large student body.  This marked the beginning of my frustration with UCSB and the whole college system.

Maybe I am just more sensitive to these things than others (in fact I’m sure that is the case) but these things really got to me.  Admittedly I had a very idealistic view of college, but I felt pretty let down by my university.  I felt that being surrounded by earnest teachers and students was not too much to ask.  Sure, messy roommates and cultural differences were one thing, but it was the academics that really mattered to me.  After all, that was the reason I chose to come to UCSB, and I often felt as if I was participating in a sort of charade - one in which the students and professors around me just pretended to care, and did the smallest amount of work they could so they could head home early.  I was amazed by my professor who blamed all of his class for failing a test he designed poorly, by students who stared at their cellphones all throughout lecture, by classmates who found their computer screens much more enticing than actually learning the material they can come to college to learn.

Sure, most of us didn’t really give a shit about Native American history because we were taking it for the credit, but why were my fellow computer science majors looking at Facebook during the computer science lectures?  And this was not altogether their fault, either, because some classes were just so dull, or the teachers incomprehensible, that is was pretty much a waste time to try paying attention.  Why did it seem that everyone was contributing to this subpar experience?

I formed the opinion then that UCSB was resting on its laurels, that they were so committed to research and graduate studies that the undergraduate program had been given much less attention.  After all, UCSB is a “research university”, and this work was not being done by undergraduates for the most part.

Not to say that I really knew what to expect at that point in my life.  But still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there were a lot of things that could be improved.  

The problem was that I had this notion freshmen year, this thing in the back of my mind telling me that there was something wrong.  But hadn’t put it all together yet.  At that point I chalked it all up to “freshmen year”.  After all, college was supposed to be hard right?  And maybe my future classes would be better.  There were so many students in those classes, and I was sure that my upper division classes would be smaller, more focused, and more serious than the freshmen year classes.  After I got through a few more GEs, it would be smooth sailing, right?


year Two
Nope.

Some of the classes I took freshmen year were referred to as “weeder” classes, meaning that they were very hard and frustrating purposefully, in an attempt to scare away the less serious students.  And this made sense to me in a way - maybe my hard work be more evident during my second year.  I would begin to take more challenging and interesting classes and would not have to fight just to sign up for them.  No longer would I have professors who assigned nonsensical assignments from nonsensical books, with nonsensical due dates.

I figured that at least by the end of this year I would be on the right track.  Maybe a few more GEs and math/science classes to finish up but mostly getting into the meaty computer science I had come to college for.

It started off very much like freshmen year - tough classes, lots of homework, and the like.  My first quarter I encountered something new: a computer science class that actually seemed too easy.  Strange.  The problem I ascertained was that the computer science department was just not organized very well.  It wasn’t terrible, but it was clear that they weren’t sure what content to put in what classes, and this was exacerbated by teachers who were bad at teaching.  I had used to think that classes from other departments were not perfect, but at least my computer science classes weren’t endlessly frustrating.  This view went out the window, because I had had several computer science classes that were just as terrible as any other classes.

But my workload my sophomore year was much larger than I had encountered before.  I have always been a stressed person, and have used this stress as a motivator.  I have a chronic fear of failure, and when I am enrolled in school (which has been about my entire life), this fear has copious opportunities to present itself.  There is always some assignment to work about, and some other assignment to worry about once the first one is completed.  To succeed, I had always turned this anxiety into productive energy - after all, if I am working nobody could say I was goofing off and obviously there was a direct correlation with hard work and payoff.  So that’s why I worked really hard on every class - even the stupid ones.  I really pushed myself to the limit partially mostly because I was afraid I would fail if I did not.  If this is starting to sound unhealthy that’s because it totally is.  

I reached the singularity (as I like to call it) in my winter quarter of sophomore year.  I can distinctly remember the panic attack I had when I realized that I actually did not have enough time even for the things I didn’t want to do.  I suppose it might be better to refer to this as my midlife crisis.  I realized that something had to change for me, and instead of shopping for a sports car, I shopped for a new college.

In an attempt to better my situation, I started two ordeals: applying as a transfer student to several colleges, and trying to transfer into the “college of creative studies” at UCSB.  I was fed up with UCSB at this point and felt that I had taken enough classes to realize that it was not up to my standards.  

Ultimately, my transfer to the college of creative studies failed, and only produced another faction at UCSB for me disdain.  I could expand more on this, but it is not really the point of the piece.  But I developed a pretty negative opinion of the college of creative studies.  Supposedly the hardest and most prestigious of the three colleges of UCSB - CCS was supposedly full of very intelligent and self-driven students who cared about learning for learning’s sake.  These kids were supposed to be on another level compared to the college of engineering and letters and science students.  This description seemed to fit me perfectly, which is only of the reasons why I was so interested.

Interested in learning? Check.
Self motivated? Check.
Hard working? Check.
Doesn’t need unnecessary classes and requirements? Check.

This sounded like the perfect program for me, and I still attribute their rejection of me mostly to how confused I was about the whole ordeal.  Honestly my interaction with the CCS department and the students therein has led me to respecting that department even less than the college of engineering.  It’s not that I really have any animosity towards them as human beings, but rather, I feel that the whole system is a sort of charade - just a different one than the college of engineering.  This college was filled with students who were told that they were special so much by the administration that they started to believe it.  Credit was award, based on ho much shit the kid got done while he was fucking around on his own laptop instead of paying attention while the professor was speaking.  The classes were small, and it seemed that none of the stunts actually paid attention to much - instead staring at their own computers and absent mindedly consuming the free pizza.

  My attempt to transfer universities was in flux, and I received a waitlist letter from Vanderbilt University towards the end of the year.  I actually did not know if I would be returning to UCSB for a third year, and at the end of the year, I bid farewell to all of my close friends, telling them that I had no idea if I would be returning the following year.

Year Three
I did.

In my third year I decided that I would do things differently.  Following some advice I had received from a counsellor at my school.  We confronted with stressful things in my life I tried asking myself why those things were stressing me out and what was really going on in my head that made me stressed out.  I wanted to be more analytic and find out what was happening in my head when I encountered stressful and anxiety producing situations.

This seemed to help to some extent, and after I had done this for a few days I noticed an acute decrease in the anxiety I felt in certain stressful situations.  This felt amazing to me, and I was worried that it would not last.

It did not.  And the rest of the year was an exercise in late nights, impossible assignments, and more that enough stress for any one person.  I had developed by this point the ability to meticulously plan my life by weeks at a time.  Really this was because I was so busy doing homework all the time, and did weekend activities so infrequently, that knew just about everything that I was doing for the next seven days ataxy given time.

I struggled at this point my life with high anxiety and depression, and I started going to group therapy, which helped me a great deal.  It had become pretty clear to me that there wasn’t any way I could really become happier in college and I came to believe I would never enjoy it.  There was just too much red tape, too much evident disrespect and inefficiency.  There was a distinct dichotomy between the engineering and science students like myself who worked their asses off, and everyone else who mostly fucked around and drank beer all the time.  

One of the best things about my third year was that my college career was over halfway over.  At this point I had pretty much given up my ideals about college life and slipped into a funk, looking forward only to the summer, and afterwards, my fourth and final year at school.

Year Four
The best thing about my final year was that is was my final year.  Unfortunately, three years was enough time to negatively affect my psyche.  By this I mean that at this point I found it pretty hard to relax.  I came to realize that I was terrible at relaxing.  Any free time I had was instantly filled with anxiety.  After all, if I had free time to be sitting around thinking and not being anxious, I must be forgetting something really important I have to do.  Thus, I was more comfortable when I had a lot of work to do, which of course made me anxious.

Despite my attempts to prevent and alluvia this process, my entire waking life was driven off anxiety.  To the point at which I constantly had something running through my mind causing my anxiety and stress.  All of this constantly stress, naturally led to depression.  Towards the beginning of this year I was very depressed.  I was so sick of this whole experience and even though it was going to be over soon, I felt like I had been permanently affected negatively.  In my own words, UCSB had pretty much fucked me up in the head.

Anxiety had lead to stress which had led to depression and all of this depression eventually lead to apathy in many parts of my life.  “Who gives a shit” I kept thinking.  “What the fuck is the point?”.  But of course I could never really give up, because the underlying anxiety that drove me to keep studying was to powerful - it was still the primary motivator.  But for reasons that are not altogether apparent to me, some part me knew that I had to keep trying.  I couldn’t just accept that I would be depressed forever.

My first attempt was antidepressants, which (surprise), made me depressed.  They made me feel even more like the whole things was fucking pointless.  So I stopped that.

The second attempt was meditation, which I started doing halfway through the year.  The decision to begin meditating was probably the best decision I have made in the last four years.  I did this every morning at 7am.  I am still not really sure why I kept at it in the very beginning - probably because I got to see some different faces for a few minutes every day, and didn’t have to listen toadying drunk people yelling.  Regardless, practicing meditation slowly alleviated my anxiety, and had almost a restorative effect only psyche.

Two of my quarters were not that bad, and one was hell, thanks to a particularly hard class in operating systems.  The interesting thing about the operating systems class was that I was happy I had the experience.  This is because the stress and anxiety produced by the class were due entirely to its difficulty, and not to the inefficiency of the processor.

In the midst of  inexplicably bad professors and TAs, where were hard to understand, disorganized, and rude, there was a shining star.  I have taken several classes I really enjoyed at UCSB.  Some of them actually computer science classes.  This operating systems class I think was the pinnacle - almost 100% of the difficulty was due to academic challenge, not accents, or nonsense - just hard work.  I don’t shy away from hard work either, and after the long and arduous 10 weeks, I ripped this class a new asshole.

The end of the year was an anti-climax.  It kind of just stopped.  Then I was a graduate.  It’s weird how the finals week was laid out - some of my friends had taken their finals and finished everything a few days before graduation, and had a few days to fuck around, drink, and just generally do nothing.  That is not animosity in my tone, but rather envy.  I would be doing the same thing in their situation, but my final test was on Friday of finals week.  And graduation was on Saturday.  So I was studying for my final up until the day before I graduated.  I know that I could probably have fucked around as well and left all of my studying until Thursday, but it was just not in my nature.  I used a little bit of every day to study for that test.  Not that I needed to, academically speaking.  But I would have been stressed if I did not use the time to study.  This is the exact kind situation my school put me into every year - low grade stress for the entire week, due to poor planning - honestly who has a final the day before graduation?  This guy apparently.

So my final week of college was pretty much like the previous four years - mostly studying, and stress and a little bit of respite.  And then, on Saturday, it ended.  I didn’t believe it was really over until I got all my grades online, and even now I won’t believe I really graduated until I get my diploma in the mail.

Year N
N is used for an indeterminately large number when calculating the running time of algorithms.  In run time analysis, algorithms that have a run time proportional to their input size are said to run in “linear” time.  Slower algorithms can take longer, and some run in “polynomial” or “exponential” time. 

In run time analysis, a small number like 4 is considered negligible when the input size is much much larger, in the thousands to millions.  

Four years of my life were devoted to UCSB, and I know plenty of other students, parents, teachers, and various adults who look at the undergraduate college education as quick and enjoyable.  Their college career was simply a flash - an incredibly enjoyable and memorable small fragment of their life.  When I first came to college people were telling me that the four years would go by in the blink of an eye.  After I graduating, people were talking about how it all happening in the blink of an eye.

This is bullshit.

I think that for plenty of other students this was quite accurate, and I think that’s because they enjoyed their time at college.  And good for them honestly, I think that’s fine.  I’m glad someone enjoyed college.  The last four years of my life have felt like a chore, like something I just had to get through to actually start my life.  I spent a lot of time trying to not feel like this.  I spent probably 90% of my time in college agonizing over why I didn’t enjoy it, and how I could find a way to have a good time.  Trying to be in the moment and appreciate what I have, to be more positive.  And I have gotten better at this.  I have become more accepting and understanding in the last couple of years.  I have gained more patience and self control.

My experience at UCSB did not seem to fly by, and I did not love it at all.  It took me quite a while before I feel okay with this, eventually the message sunk in - I don’t have to like college.  Despite what anyone else might say, it was totally fine to not love my college experience.  It was good enough for me to know that I did enjoy computer science, and I knew that no matter how much I disliked college, there had to be something positive at the other side, because I was going into a field I genuinely enjoyed.  The good thing is I like computer science.  Like a lot.  What’s better is that I have each job already, and didn’t have to sit at home after graduating wondering what the hell to do with my life.  I can still wonder what the hell to do with my life, but at least I will be working while I am doing it.

So where does that leave me, anyway?  Going to college was the most stressful thing I have ever done.  I thought about quitting so many times, and the amount of stress and anxiety I coped with was enough to be physically sickening.

In a certain sense I am grateful for this experience though.  I spent four years subjecting myself to an environment antithetical to my character.  I like to think that I dealt with maybe twenty or thirty years of stress in only four years, and it forced my to come up with coping mechanisms.  I did, to a certain extent.  I managed to cope with a lot of the stress UCSB caused me, and meditation, which changed my life more than anything else in the last several years.  

Does this mean that I am happy I had the experience?  Not really.  I would have liked to like college, and I think that it would have been possible to have had that experience.  But I didn’t, and I know that over time I will care less and less about this.  What I have learned is that I need to live in the moment, and now that college is over, I will stop thinking about it.  I have learned that the most important thing in my life is whatever is happening right now.  The most important thing to me right now is washing the dishes.

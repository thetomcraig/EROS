	<string>After the first week Chang stopped showing up to our groups' meetings when they were arranged over the phone and in person, even when she agreed to be present beforehand.  She contributed literally nothing to every single stage of our project, and even stopped showing up to lecture towards the end of the course.  She also stopped responding to all contact that occurred over the phone as the quarter drew to a close.  She told us, and our TA  she would be working on certain aspects of our project that were never made.

Chang and another group member, Houjie, contributed so little to our project that the three of us (Michael, Tyralyn, and myself) were stressed and unable to finish what we had hoped we could.  We believed Chang to be working on graphics for the entire quarter, as she said she would, but had to make all the graphics ourselves.

I believe Chang Sun to be an anomaly as I have never before encountered someone who not only contributed nothing to a project, and in fact, actively tried to avoid doing work.  She often disappeared after lecture when the rest of our group was talking without a word to what she was doing.  On the rare occasion during which she did show up to one of our meetings I have no dea what she worked on because she never spoke to any of us and appeared to be looking at our code, and diagrams.  She said she worked with Houjie at one point but as neither of them spoke much of their doings within the group, I have no way to verify this.  

I want to reiterate that what I have written here is in no way an exaggeration.  Again, she contributed literally nothing to our project and in fact detracted from it due to the frustration she caused Michael, Tyralyn, and me.  I consider myself to be a generous person, but 0/25 is exactly what I believe she deserves for this part of the course.  

While Chang, and Houjie to an only slightly lesser degree, have caused me very much personal anxiety this quarter, this problem extends beyond me.  Michael and Tyralyn worked with me this quarter and the three of us did close to 100% of the work on our project, and the work was difficult to divvy up between only three members.  I am sure that the three of us would have worked better devoid of Houjie and Chang with a project of a slightly smaller scope.

I could write more about Chang because I am in disbelief at how little she seemed to care about our project, and her personal grade in the course.  However, I will conclude by saying that I think 0/25 points is fully justified and I think our TA Cetin did a good job helping the three of us manage this issue.</string>

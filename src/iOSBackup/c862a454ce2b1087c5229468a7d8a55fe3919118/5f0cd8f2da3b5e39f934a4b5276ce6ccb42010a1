	<string>Staying up later than I should, and no time to do everything, sound familiar? Things are going pretty well with Sid, I mean it's not perfect, but I thinly it's better than last time and should get better in the future. Ready to tell friends and looking for the right time. 

Got the JPL job pretty much (knock on wood) and now I have to learn fortran. I'll make that inside project, because I have time for those. Have t touch the arduino for the robot project in a while. I will tomorrow. Gotta buckle down and get shit done, which is really all I e been doing. Weekend should be packed to the brim with fun homework!</string>

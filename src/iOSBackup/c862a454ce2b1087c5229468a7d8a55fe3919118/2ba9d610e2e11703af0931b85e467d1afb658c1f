	<string>Living the dream I guess.
Things are going pretty well - I am coming up on three weeks at Pandora, and I am really liking it.  I guess I’m still getting used to how relaxed it is.  People normally show up around 9-9:30, maybe even 10am and leave at around 5 or 5:30.  I am one of the first people to get there every day.  It is still weird actually being paid to do something I like all day.  I am a little bummed that I am paying so much in rent… About half my paycheck, but at least I don’t have to be spending money on much else right now.  I am liking Oakland too, I have been over to SF a few times and it was pretty cool - but I am not sad I’m living here.  And maybe I’ll move over there some time - seriously I am guilty about how much I’m spending on rent.  

All of my coworkers seem really great too, one of them is a new grad guy like me and everyone else is a bit older - some are married and I think a few have kids.  I expected a lot of structure, but people seem to pick up tasks as needed and we meet 2 times a week and people discuss what they’ve been doing.  I think I am acclimating pretty well to this atmosphere devoid of the stress from college, but it still haunts me, when I feel like I should be working faster or harder or accomplishing more.  

But one good thing is that I am not fearing being fired every day, which I thought might be a possibility.  I am working on detoxing from UCSB, but it’s not a really painful process.  I think with more time I will acclimate a bit more.

Things with Sidney seem okay.  I saw her this past weekend and we talked a bit - not a long discussion but closure more than anything else.  I am trying to figure out if I miss her.  I don’t think I do though, I think I just really like being in a relationship, I like that sense of security.  I fee like I miss her, but really, I think I miss having a girlfriend.  There was some sexual tension I think when we saw each other, and I don’t want to make a decision I’ll regret…  I don’t feel the way I did when we broke up - fed up with her.  but I know that breaking up was the right decision.  I am thinking about trying to find someone soon to take my mind off of her, but I’m not sure thats such a good idea…  I won’t see her this weekend though so at the very least I will have 2 weeks away (maybe more) to try to get over it.

Other than that things are pretty great, a little boring, but I like my apartment and town and job and coworkers.  Honestly after box much I bitched at UCSB, I don’t think I should complain about a single thing for at least 2 or 3 years.

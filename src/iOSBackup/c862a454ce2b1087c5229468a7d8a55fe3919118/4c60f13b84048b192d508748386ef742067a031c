	<string>The more things change.
So I don’t like school.  That’s a big constant as much as I have changed recently, this school is really good at piling shit on me to deal with.  I don’t really need to get into it, but  suffice it to say that there are incompetent teachers and situations that are making my life stressful.

Sidney and I are pretty good so far, though it is hard to tell right now how things will go.

I have decide that I don’t mind taking longer to graduate if it means that I can take classes with teachers that don’t suck; I am really tired of having crappy teachers make my life hell.  Really I am over it, I am tried of whining about it too. 

Overall, things are pretty good.  Though I still feel a bit of a disconnect with my emotions, and some perfectionism tendencies that I am not sure what to do with.

Anyway, midterms are all over so I can relax for a little while.

I have been making more of an effort to meet new people which I think is good.  

Focusing on people and emotions I think is really good for me.

My job is pretty good too, I am just answering phones right now, which means I can be doing homework.

Nothing too exciting in here really… 

I am grateful for for friendly strangers.</string>

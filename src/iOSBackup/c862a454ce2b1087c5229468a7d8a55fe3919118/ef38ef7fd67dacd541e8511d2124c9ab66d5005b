	<string>Interesting day. Long. Told Sidney that I sometimes get unnecessarily jealousy and she said she does too. So that's cool. Liz, swipper woman at Ortega, talked to me and said she knew me. Turned in TA evals for English. I read them all; people sick and clearly expect a TA to spoon feed them everything. Gave Chang Sun 0/25 on her recommendation form. Because she's terrible. So terrible. I'm officially done with math homework for the Rey of my life, hopefully. Late night with Adam and Sidney. Nate is not going to be living in San Rafael next quarter because hell be a TA :/. Robots meeting can cancelled. Still feeling a bit sick and hoping nothing serious like last time. So done with this quarter!!  
PS My eval of Chang sun is the pervious entry. So it is memorialized</string>

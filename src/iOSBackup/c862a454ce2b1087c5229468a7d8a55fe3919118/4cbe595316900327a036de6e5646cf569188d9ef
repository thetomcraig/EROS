	<string>Watched Body Snatchers (1993) last night with Sid. We were on the sixth floor and all those people were really nice. The movie was good too. I can't say I didn't think about Sid, watching a movie alone with her. Man I hate that expression "alone together". Anyway moving to just being friends with Sid was actually much easier than I thought it would be. I miss her, holding her and kissing her. But she is such a good friend I'm ok with the way things are. 
MacBook charger died. Good thing I don't absolutely need my computer to study. Going to schedule apple appointment as soon as I get back. 

Still working on getting a username I can use with everything. 

Saw Adrian at breakfast today. I guess he only wants to eat with us when he can't. I'm done with him. I wish I wasn't in computer science with him be amuse I'm totally done with him

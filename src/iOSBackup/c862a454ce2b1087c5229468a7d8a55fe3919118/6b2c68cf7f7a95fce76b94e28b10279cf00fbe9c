So things are more or less getting back to normal.  It’s weird though, this whole tragedy at school has affected everyone I think.  In a very logical sense it’s good for me because my teachers are giving me a bit less work for the end of the year and I can kind of take it easy.  But at the same time that makes me nervous.  It bothers me to be stressed all of the time and then all of the sudden not have to stress anymore.  I don’t really work that way.   It really makes me more stressed, because I feel guilty, like I should be working, and I’m just not used to it and become unsettled.  This is the same reason why I have been stressed this quarter — well, it’s one of the reasons why I’ve been stressed this quarter.  I don’t have a a lot of free time and Tuesday-Thursday I am really stressed and then friday afternoon I have free time.  This bothers be because I feel like I have to make perfect use of that time or else I’ve squandered it.  Not to mention how guilty I feel when I am not doing work for such a long time.  

I think a lot about how I wish I was different.  About how I wish I could care less.  To a certain extend I have been able to care less.  Which has been great, really.  I care a lot less about school than I used to.  I don’t know when I may come back and read this, but the fact of the matter is that I need to give less of a shit.  Giving less of a shit is hard for me, but giving less of a shit really is what I need to do to be happier.  With the kind of shit I do, caring is what causes me the most stress.  Some of the homework I have is literally impossible.  Most of it is just unimaginably hard.  I’m talking, like all day on one question of a 6 question assignment.  I don’t know what I kind of person I will be in the future, but when I say all day, I mean like 8:30am to 3:30… pm…  So, future Tom Craig, I don’t what you’re doing when you are reading this but you deserve a break.  Honestly I work harder than anyone else I know.  And that can be a good thing.  But it can also be a very dangerous thing.  Sometimes the best thing to do is give up, which is what is hard for me to do.  And this is stupid, because this is so unlike the real world.  I won’t have a boss who purposefully obscures information from me, or expects me to do something without telling me what any of the words mean.  

It’s so stupid — how unlike the real world all of this shit is, really.  But I am becoming better, and this year has been the best for me in terms of stress and happiness.

Sidney and I have also come a long way.  Our relationship last year was special, but nothing like what we have now.  I feel really good about it.  And while my goal this year was to get laid, and that didn’t happen, I am still happy with my relationship.  It’ also worth noting that while we haven’t had vaginal sex, we’ve come pretty damn close.  Like, quite literally.  And I have worked my way through all the condoms I got senior year of high school.  Almost.  

The weird thing, that you wouldn’t expect, is that the problem Sidney and I have is that we spend too much time together.  We get tired of each other.  It’s hard because we work so well together.  I wouldn’t really want to work with anyone else over her, and we can program, really well together.  But we are also in a relationship and want to spend time with each other, so this makes it difficult because work and play are done with each other, so we don’t often get a break from one another.  But the good thing is that we both understand and feel the same way about this issue, so we actually are going to try to do something about it next school year.

I can’t believe this year is almost over.  It’s weird, and I can almost not believe that I have finished three years here.  It’s good though, and I can’t wait to get out of here (sad, but true).  But it’s weird nonetheless.

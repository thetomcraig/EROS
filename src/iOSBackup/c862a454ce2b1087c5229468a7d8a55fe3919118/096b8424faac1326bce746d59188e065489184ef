	<string>Home for Christmas.

Well here I am at home (Laguna).  And this past quarter ended terribly.  Not that it was sad or anything, but all of my classes got incredibly difficult at the last minute, and I didn’t get much sleep.  But my finals are over and I don’t think I failed any classes!  And so ends my final fall quarter at UC.  I have been getting more and more excited about my Pandora job and actually using the product.  Having said that though, I am feeling kind of depressed, which I think is a side effect of the Zoloft.  So it’s making me feel less anxious but depressed instead.  So I don’t think I hit the nail on the head there.  But the mindfulness and meditation I think is helping on that front, I just need to find the correct balance I think.

This fall quarter was pretty much representative of my entire time at UCSB.  From about week 3 to week 10 I was constantly working and did not have much time at all to take a break so I was constantly either stressed depressed and or sleep deprived.  It’s terrible honestly, I really wish that I had more time to actually relax and spend time with friends and the like, but I am always getting work done.  But I suppose my working so hard has contributed to the job I got at Pandora.  

I am going to try to relax this break (all 2 weeks of it :( ), and I am ready to just be done with my school.</string>

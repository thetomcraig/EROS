	<string>Getting used to it.
Getting used to this quarter, unfortunately PSTAT is going to be the worst piece of shit ever.  The bestI can do is try to have it not ruin my life.  Which I think I can do.
Aside from that everything else is pretty good.  I still haven’t really done much new for ResNet, but my programming job is going pretty well, my only complaint being that I wish I had more time on personal projects.   Sound familiar.  I finished the app I made, I’m just afraid to distribute it.  But when I do I have some other cool projects in mind.

Sidney and I recently had a talk — I basically mentioned that I was not really getting enough free time, and she was much more understanding than I thought she would be.  Which is good — that’s what you would want in a significant other.

Not sure if I am going to go home this weekend.  I can make it work but it’s always frustrating with trying to get work done.  Also it’s difficult because I do just about all my work with Sidney and I feel like I would be doing her a disservice.  But I really shouldn’t feel that way — or at least I feel like I shouldn’t.  I really want to see my family so I shod be able t do that…

Regardless it’s not a huge deal, I’l figure it out.

I am grateful for understanding friends and family.</string>

	<string>I can't stop thinking about that girl Alex. I'm not even interested in her I just want to befriend her. I think for me she represents change. New people and new prospects. I want to befriend her because it would feel like some sort of progress would be made. I also am kind of interested heh. Maybe I'm just starved for female attention because the Sidney think was such a blue-balls fest. I don't know. </string>

	<string>Bailed on running, den though I got out of bed early to do so.  I kind of got in a shitty mood towards the end of today that has continued until today.  I don't know why, but the idea of running did not appeal to me at all.  Honestly I rely hate running in the morning and the fact that it is the only time I can really annoys me.  Part of this is that I am pretty much done with this quarter.  I think I will try to run later today around 5 or so, even though I doubt that'll happen.</string>

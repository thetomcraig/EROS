	<string>Week one.

Well, it has been an interesting week or so.  I am in UCSB and not totally hating being back like I thought I would.  I have made time to make new friends and have not yet had that much school work to do, so that is nice, and it means this first week has not been as anxiety producing as school often is.

Sidney and I have been making time to meet people in Manzanita (where we both live) and I am pretty proud of myself for putting so much work into it, I was well-intentioned, but not as dedicated last year.

I have also been looking into getting a job on campus, and I have been applying to several.  More on this later.

Sidney and I have talked a couple of times about us, and I have been thinking a lot about what exactly I would want from a relationship, and if I am sure I really do want it.  I think I do, but thinking about it for the past couple of days has really made me realize a lot of things, and led some important realizations.

This is really important, and I have been feeling differently for probably a week and a half, but have not yet had time to write about it. Something has changed in me, and I cannot yet tell if it really is a change, or some sort of veneer.  If it is a change, I cannot tell either how permanent it may be.

After talking to Mark before I came back to school, I reached the conclusion that emotion was the thing lacking in my life.  Emotional relationships were not as strong as they could be, and this played into the perfectionism issue, to make me particular, and emotionally charged about my high expectations.  The solution is making more, better relationships.  

After talking to Sidney about a week ago about is being together, I thought a lot about why exactly I wanted to be with her, and the emotions I felt towards being with her, and not being with her.  Essentially, fear is prominent, and I really delved into this emotion.  But more than this, I really thought about the emotions I was feeling, realizing how important they were, and how the affected me.  

I also watched a video in which Louis CK talked about this kind of thing as it related to smart phones.  The idea being that we, as humans, are so obsessed with the technology, that we use it to blind ourselves to the emotions we normally feel, so that we are never really sad, but never really happy either.  He describes a time in which he was feeling depressed, and resisted testing someone, so that he could focus on the emotion and have it hit him like a truck.  

I think I have been doing this kind of thing with perfectionism, and using it as a coping mechanism for my insecurities.  Because I am convinced that people don't like me, I feel that I need to do something to prove to those people that I am someone who schooled be liked.  For this reason I have always believed that you are what you do.  Which is only have the story.  But what I was doing, was similar to what Louis CK talked about, in the sense that I was not really feeling these emotions I was having because I was masking them.

I really thought about the thing with Sidney, and also did a few things like let myself truly and deeply feel the loneliest I felt with living in a single room in a  building full of strangers, something changed in me.  And for about a week,  have been changed.  I have somehow let go of the perfectionism issues I was struggling with before.  I think it has something to do with this attention I have been paying to my emotions, and the energy I have been putting into friends and family and those relationships.  It feels like a weight has been lifted off of me, and I feel like I am not being tortured by some of the thoughts and feelings I ave been struggling with for the past several years.

For instance, I sat next to someone in class who had a truly disgusting macbook, that was covered in dirt and smudges, and he proceeded to eat beef jerky over it, and check out reddit and Facebook ruling the first lecture of class.  This kind of thing normally pisses me off.  But for some reason I wasn't really bothered at all by this incident.

Indeed I have encountered a lot of things like this recently.  I am just simply not being bothered by the things that used to bother me.  I definitely notice them, and the emotion is still there, but it is not being magnified like Mark says.  I suppose tho is the problem that Mark was talking about - Magnification.  I really have been allowing myself to be consumed by the emotions I connect to the things that bother me, and wishing that the didn't bother me at all.  I guess I wasn't really thinking that it was possible to lessen the severity of these things.  I am worried now that this is just something that won't last forever, but I am hoping that shifting my focus towards friends and emotional relationships, maybe I can reatain these notions.

I feel almost like I have reached an enlightened state, like I am above my emotions, watching them come to me in slow motion.  I used to see soothing an instantly hate it, feeling as if there was nothing I could do to feel differently about it.  Now I see something that I know will annoy me, anticipate that emotion, see it arrive, look at it and examine it, and then put it away.  I feel like I have reached this state that they talk about it the context of meditation.  This sort of disassociation with your emotions, and having more of a control over them.  I supposed I didn't really know that that was all about until know.  

I am a little confused about how it happened though. I suppose it just came from me thinking about the emotions I am feeling, and how important the emotions are and how they affect me etc.  

I realized, through Katya, and Nick Wong, that you are not entirely what you do.  Katya (and I think Nick Wong) do not hate me for what I did to them.  [Nick Wong was my former roommate who got clingy, and I had to awkwardly bail on living with him at the end of freshmen year].  And talking to Sidney and this and some other stuff has really made me realize that people don't dislike me as often or as severely as I think they do [if they do at all...]  

I have a fear that this means I am kind of a shell of myself.  Like I have become distanced from all my emotions, and releasing the emotions connected with perfectionism has made me less emotional overall.  I don't quite think so thought, but I will have to wait until something truly emotional happens for this to be really evidenced.

Overall I have noticed that I have become more accepting and patient and outgoing.  I believe that I already have the characteristics outwardly, but I now have them internally.

This relates to Sidney, we are still both thinking about the whole relationship thing, and I am not freaking out and being anions like I normally would be.  I think focusing on the emotional part of my life has done me a lot of good, and I hope it is for the better and continues to be.

Now I need to focus on strengthening the relationships I have and hopefully making some new ones.  Need to sleep, much going on!

	<string>Weekend good, but still want to be done.

On Saturday Sidney and I went to brunch and then a retro video game store I found online.  It was really good of us to do that I think because we rarely take breaks and actually doing something relaxing.  Then we worked with our teammate in our Capstone group - Michael.  And then later we worked on some other homework.  It was really good for us to actually take a break, even though we were very annoyed with our capstone project.  Conversations were good and I was good to spend time with Sidney not doing homework - 4/5.

Sunday kind of sucked because we spent a lot of time on our capstone project, and its just so fucking frustrating to work on.  Web development is really annoying because everyone in our group is trying to figure stuff out, but keeps finding trouble actually implementing stuff.  There is only so much we can do though, and we are doing everything we can in the project.  It’s week 9 now, so this quarter is almost over.  Sidney can get really emotional about the work we have to do, which can get on my nerves, and I really wish it didn’t, and this is something I’m trying to work on.  Conversations weren’t that good unfortunately… - 2/5</string>

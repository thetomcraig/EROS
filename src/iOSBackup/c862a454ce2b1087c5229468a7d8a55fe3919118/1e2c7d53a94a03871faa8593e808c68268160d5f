I think I am beginning to figure it out.  I was thinking about my project - Computer Pile II today.  It's a computer I built to play games.  Anyway I was thinking about how I might not actually use it at school at all, and how my laptop can do all the things it could etc. and how I needn't bother bringing ti when I go back in a few weeks.  I was thinking about all the game controllers I bought and didn't use and how that bothers me.  Material things I have and don't use bother me, material things that aren't perfect also bother me.

It hit me.  I have been thinking about this who business of material things and it hit me - the material things won't ever be perfect.  Yeah I know, this is not a big realization.  But what hit me is that I have this almost addiction to material objects.  I fixate on how the thing will solve problems once I get it, and how great it will be for me.  Again, I know, not an intreating realization.  But what I realized about myself in this sense, is that I go out of my way to do this.  When I don't even need anything new, I convince myself of a reason for needing the thing.  My backpack is yadda yadda yadda, I need a new one.  Oh my monitor is so and so, I need a new one. 

And sometimes I do need a new object, and it's good that I buy a new version.  But aI can't assume that this will be brining me happiness.  I am so convinced that there is a perfect formula, a perfect collection of perfect objects, that will flu fill my limited needs and make me happy.  But I should be happy before I buy the new mouse or monitor, not because of the purpose.  I like the allure of new things, new things will make me happy I think. 

I guess this is normal, but I can become incredibly fixated on something to the point of exhaustion.  When I think I need to change something, it becomes the most important thing in the world to me.

And when I don't want new things, I find new things to want and lust after them.  It's bad.  

The problem is, I'm afraid.  I'm afraid that stripping down to myself, beyond material objects, and situations and girlfriends, and relationships, and school, getting down to my core, is, well... I don't know.  I don't even though if I can do it.  Because I am so... I don't know... External?  No, I am pretty introverted most of the time....

I don't really know.  So much of me is devoted to the external world and making it perfect.  I don't know what lies beneath.  But I am afraid if I try to have happiness tag tomes from elsewhere, it will be illusive, even more that now.

By thinking that perfection makes me happy, I have the notion that I may not always be totally happy, but can be with a little more work.  But this is of course a lie, because perfection is impossible.  But if I am supposed to have happiness come from others, well, I don't know.  What if my friends leave?  What if my girlfriend dumps me?  I don't know.  If happiness doesn't come from near perfect objects and experiences, I'm not sure where exactly it will come from.

But I think I am on the right track with happiness not coming from physical things.</string>

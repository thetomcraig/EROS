	<string>Faith
Back from a three day weekend at home.  This was the first time I went “home” to somewhere not in South Pasadena.  It was good though, I really like being home whoever that may be.  The beach house is small and definitely and cramped, but seeing my parents was good, and I played some mine craft with Jack and Alfred while I was home.  I mostly worked on a computer science project, but it wasn’t that stressful.  Of course, now that I am back, I have plenty of stuff to do!  But I am not as stressed as I have been in the past.

I think I made some really good progress on that front.  Stress, that is.  I have come to realize that I needn’t be stressed about a lot of the things that stressed me in the past, and I do not really need that tress to succeed like I thought I did.

I think I am getting the hang of this perfectionism thing - at the beginning of the year something happened to me and I was able to put away the stress I have been carrying.  To replace this though, I have a very faith-heavy look on my life right now.  Not in a religious sense, but I have faith in myself.  I trust myself to complete the work I need to complete and I trust myself to have studied enough for a test or worked hard enough on an assignment.  Rather than looking at the output of every action, I am trying to focus on the input - how much work I put into activities, and how hard I try, I think this is more important.  

To replace this perfectionism focus, I am been trying to work on relationships and trying to make people more important in my life.  I think I am doing a good job of this so far.  And it is why I am considering getting a Facebook account again….

I think faith is an apt word for me to use, I am trusting of myself and friends and situations.  I am controlling enough to focus on faith and still put in enough effort (I think).  Anyway I have to run to work, but I am proud of myself for how far I have come in a few short months. 

I am grateful for my group therapy that I am going to today, I think it has really helped me.

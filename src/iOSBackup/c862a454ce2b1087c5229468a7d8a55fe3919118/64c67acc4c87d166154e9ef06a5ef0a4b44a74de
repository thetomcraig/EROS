Going through cycles of the feels.  Home now for Christmas which is nice.  Using my PTO days from work and spending time with my family.

Still really liking work a lot and I am definitely a happier person now than I was in college, almost like I am a different person.  Woking on some stuff that I want to work on and really just relaxing for the holidays.

I’m off online dating - way too demoralizing and soul crushing.  Though these kinds of things happen in phases, so I really won’t be surprised if I end up coming back to online dating in some fashion.

At the sam time though I do really miss Sidney.  I just can’t convince myself that it would be a good idea to tell her that I want to get back together.  One of the reasons I broke up with her in the first place was the issue of love - I felt like she really loved me and I had just kind of become tired of her.  I just felt annoyed more than anything else.  

I do still have feelings for her though - I just don’t think that I love her.  I guess that’s what it comes does to really, I just don’t think I love her.  Or, really, I don’t think I can love her again.  I really miss her, and I really miss being in a relationship, and those two things are intertwined right now such that I can’t really tell the difference between the two.  I really like spending time with her, and I can tell she does like hanging out with me.  Things are pretty copacetic in that regard, I just don’t know if getting back together with her would lead to me loving her again.  And that’s what I am afraid of.  I don’t think it would be fair to her to lead her on like that.  Even if she knew how I felt and I told her everything I was feeling, it would still be leading her on.  I just don’t know if the way I was feeling was an indication of an underlying problem with our relationship, or more of a product of my discontent with my environment.  

I really want to be in a relationship, and she is someone who I have been in a relationship with, so it seems safer.  I *think*.  I suppose I could tell her how I feel about this, but I still don’t think it would be ver fair to her.

In the meantime I guess I can try to pick up chicks in, like, the park.  How the fuck?</string>

	<string>Final winter quarter.  

So this is my final winter quarter.  Bittersweet, as always.  I will soon be done taking my medication entirely.  I have been feeling stressed again I thin because I stopped taking the meds and a little depressed still.  I really hate to keep saying it, but at this point, I just think I need to get out of here and will be feeling not so hot until I graduate.  I don’t think this is the best place for me at all.

I visited Sidney’s family at the end of the break which was nice.  I really like them and can tell they like me.  I could tell when I was visiting them that I have gotten better at not caring what people think of me.  But having said that, I still have anxiety to deal with which is affecting me physically (chest pains).  So at this point I can feel either depressed or constantly anxious.  Not ideal.  But I think I would rather be off the medication if it means I feel more “normal” even if that entails feeling stressed all the time. 

I don’t know, honestly I just don’t know what to do.  But I know I don’t want to give up.  Whatever that really means - killing myself?  I don’t know, I know I don’t want to do that.  I just wish it were a bit easier to not feel this way, and I also don’t know why it is that I have gotten worse over time.  

Either way I am grateful for some things.  My family and friends, Sidney, the things I have and people I know, and the rewarding things about this school.  Of which there are some.  

I think there are going to be some good things in this quarter and I am looking forward to them.

I have also been meditating a lot more, daily, which has been making feel a bit better.  Right now I am focusing on that and on getting a bit more exercise.  I have been reading a Zen book that I have really been enjoying and is changing the way I think about some things.</string>

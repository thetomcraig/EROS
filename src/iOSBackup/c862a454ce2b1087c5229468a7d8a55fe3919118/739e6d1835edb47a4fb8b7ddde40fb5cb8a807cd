	<string>Really would like to hear from Vanderbilt. I don't really have high hopes for Brown. I didn't get into Rice so I don't have high hopes because of that, but Vanderbilt could happen. I really hope it does. I don't know if I'll leave but I want to have the option. Occidental could be that option if no other school presents itself. I am checking my email constantly now and both brown and Vanderbilt have said that now is the time they will email decisions to students. 

Going back to school, weekend at home was nice. I did some physics homework and worked on the pi; I bout a case for it out if a hard drive enclosure, so maybe now I can actually use it for something. I have a hit more connection work to do and it and it can be a sweet little emulator or server maybe. Have a snes and psone controller to use with it. 

Got a graphics card for the other computer I built - one that have it hdmi. It worked but had a fan that wouldn't shut the fuck up. So I am going to send that thing back. Making that computer (n64) will be a summer project I suppose. About a month left in the quarter! And it cannot come soon enough. 

Failed to sell the Nexus, can't believe I can't even get $150 for the thing. Maybe I'll just use it again, I'm getting really tired of carrying my computer around and it's making my back hurt. 

Watched a lot of Kahn academy for statistics.  I should really start doing that when I get back to school. 

I didn't white realize this until recently but I had sort of reconciled myself to breaking up with Sidney by the end of the year (because of transferring). But even if I don't transfer I think I'm going to have to do it. I'd felt ten kind of fed up with the lack of intimacy. I really thin there should be a physical aspect of a relationship and not having sex with her has gotten to be very annoying. 

I do not think my school will get much better stress-wise. I may go to occidental even if I do not get in anywhere else. Really I could use a change. At least frustrations I may have there will be different from the ones I have now. What bothers me is that occidental isn't really known for engineering. And ucsb is! Seems like occidental could suck shit for computer science! I don't really want to feel like I'm taking a step down. 

Heading back to school going to do some homework soon. Yay. </string>

Lauren flies in today, so I'd like to be around when she gets in from the airport. What we're you guys thinking? </div></div>
<div id="125760" class="received"><div class="time">10:54:00</div><div class="text">Uh oh</div></div>
<div id="125763" class="received"><div class="time">11:23:49</div><div class="text">Like 5, so we could still make it. But it wasn't really in our plans. Why, what did you have in mind? </div></div>
<div id="125784" class="received"><div class="time">13:01:16</div><div class="text">Well, we were thinking about doing some drinks somewhere around the lake if you guys want to join for that. You're more than welcome, we talked about trying to kick it with ya'll this weekend. </div></div>
<div id="125787" class="received"><div class="time">13:46:28</div><div class="text">Probably 7ish. We were gonna make some dinner first and probably bring it with. </div></div>
<div id="125788" class="received"><div class="time">14:40:07</div><div class="text">Hmm, ok hold on for a sec. Lauren's flight just got delayed, so that might change things. </div></div>
<div id="125789" class="received"><div class="time">14:43:34</div><div class="text">I'll just get in touch with when she gets in. Don't want to leave you guys in the lurch though (that's an expression right? Like making time), so if you end up going to the scavenger hunt, that's cool too. </div></div>
<div id="125830" class="received"><div class="time">20:30:08</div><div class="text">Hey, so Lauren and I are just making dinner now. Might stay in tonight, but do you guys want to go to Dolores park with us tomorrow? La Taqueria and possibly some truffles...</div></div>

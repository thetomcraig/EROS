Pretty uneventful week. This weekend I spent the whole time writing a paper, but it's the last research paper I will ever have to write!  Hopefully...

Sidney and I took a little step forward physically, as well. I am feeling really good about us currently. Which is good. 

Going home for thanksgiving soon and I cannot wait for it. 

I am glad I signed up for Facebook again. There is some ever going in right now that had to do with my grandfather and I have been able to see pictures of my relatives online. 

So while I will have to keep working hard over the thanksgiving break, I am in a good mood overall right now.  

I am working on making things more important in my life, running, my project, etc. and I am excepting that nothing is perfect. 

I am going to try meditating again do we will see how that all goes.  

I am very grateful for my family and for my friends here. 

I am grateful for all the opportunities I have. </string>

	<string>Finally settling in I guess.  Still feel off though, I'm watching TV and working on the Pi and other stuff that I really wanted to have time to do, but I don't really seem to be enjoying it fully, like I can't get lost in it.  I think I am still kind of sad.  Going to hangout with Isabel tomorrow and Rylan and Alfred later in the day.  Then off to work!</string>

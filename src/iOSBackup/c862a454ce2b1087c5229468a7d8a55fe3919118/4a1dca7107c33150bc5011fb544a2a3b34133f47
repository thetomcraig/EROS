	<string>So confused.
Well I go my neighbor’s number  - so that’s a good development.  She is a cute asian girl who works at Pandora in the auditing department.  She also lives in my building and I have run into her several times and had good conversations with her.  The only turn off is that she is 30.  I mean, it’s not a huge turn off, but it makes me a little wary.  regardless I saw her a couple of days ago and asked if she wanted to hang out and got her number.  Not that I really know what “hang out” means.  I guess because I haven’t really decided if I want to pursue her or just try to become friends with her.  This is the kind of thing that normally drives me crazy - but a little less lately.  

I have been less stressed lately - I am no longer in school and meditate daily, and exercise almost every morning (this morning is an exception…) and this has all made me much more well adjusted.  Mostly the not being in school part though.

Speaking of confusing situations with women though - I am not sure if I like a female friend at work.  We have been friends wince day one at Pandora, and I have a pretty solid small group of new grad friends at work who started around the same time.  I was not attracted to her and actually remember a month or two ago thinking that it was convenient that I was NOT attracted to her because it would never be a problem socially.  But ever since the joke was made several times that we were dating, I have been thinking about her a bit differently.  

I don’t know how to describe it other than saying that I a confused about it.  She is not really my type physically (she is taller than me and larger (not overweight, but just a larger person)).  She is also different socially - she is an organizer and always trying to get people interested and involved.  Jesus Christ, I’m talking about her like I DO like her.  I don’t know, maybe I do.  Shit.

Like I said I didn’t think about her in that way at all until the joke came up and our mutual friends joked about how we were ‘dating’.  And ever since then I have been having these ‘what if’ kind of thoughts.  If I were to guess, I would say that she is in the same position - not sure if she likes me.  It’s pretty annoying because whenever I text or talk to her now I have this second process going on in the back of my head second guessing what I saying and what she is saying, as if I am trying to figure out what the subtext is.

So, like I said, I’m pretty confused.  Pretty damn confused.  I am not sure how I feel about either of these situations, or what I should do about them.  

But I am trying to be more relaxed about this kind of thing and, in fact, I am much less stressed about this whole thing than I would have been maybe six months ago.  Overall my stress level has gone way down, which is great.  I think my tactic for both of these situations will be the same - play it by ear.  I plan to continue acting the way I have been, and in both situations, if a situation presents itself, I plan to take action.  Because honestly, what the fuck else am I going to do anyway??

The thing with Shannon is actually pretty damn confusing.  The thing is - I can’t tell if she would be too much for me.  I think I have changed a lot in the last couple of months, but I don’t know if I am the kind of person who is going to want to be doing stuff as often as she is - but then again, I would like to date someone dissimilar from me for this kind of reason - I think it makes things more interesting that dating someone who is exactly the same as you (Sidney…).  

Soooooo, yeah.  Not sure what the fuck is going on, really.  But seeing as this is a development only a few weeks old, I can wait on it.  I would not be surprised if next time I wrote in here I had some more interesting news to share…

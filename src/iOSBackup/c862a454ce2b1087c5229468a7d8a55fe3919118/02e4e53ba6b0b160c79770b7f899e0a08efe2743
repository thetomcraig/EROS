	<string>I talked to Sidney last night.  She feels like taking her shirt off probably wasn't the best idea.  Kind of a big step for her.  I totally get that.  I really want to have sex with her, so its hard for me when she wants to go so slowly.  But i think it's ok for me.  I was afraid she would say she never wanted to do it again.  Instead its more of a "too much at once, in a little bit take a smaller step" sentiment.  I'm okay with thatâ€¦  Kind of annoying, but whatever.  I got to feel her up once, which was more times than part of me thought I would.  It was pretty sweet.</string>

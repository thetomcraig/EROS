	<string>Good things.

So work is pretty awesome. Everybody I have talked to at work on my team, not on my team, and just around, has been very welcoming and just generally nice. It's amazing that that is so different from what my college experience was like, and for the past week I have been so excited to go to work, and be surrounded by the kind of people who don't look down on you, condescend to you, and it's just amazing to finally be in that situation. I feel as if I have been waiting for very long time for the situations of my life to catch up with the kind of person I am, I feel like now that I'm finally working, and the being an adult, that has happened. I mean, I'm sure this will somehow feel less magical overtime, and come to be more relaxed, but that's fine for me. I don't really need to have a very exciting in new awesome job in that respect, because honestly living in the Bay Area, and making six figures as my first job out of college, is more than I could ever ask for. I feel like I worked so hard, and yet it all seems like it was luck well. But maybe that's the way it will always feel for me, and I'm pretty sure that it is. And I'm okay with that. 

I met some new graduate hires that Pandora as well, three people my age who all seemed pretty nice had the chance to spend time with them as well. Really just can't stop thinking about how relaxed it is and how how is such a polar opposite from UCSB. I talked to one of my coworkers who graduated from UCSB in 2002, he even knew some of the shitty teachers I had had, and agreed that they were indeed shitty. And another one of the coworkers I talked to my team said 5hat it took her a while to figure out why everyone was so nice, or to come to accept that everyone is so nice, I think really the reason is that Pandora and Pandora employees choose to hire nice people, which is good, because I think that was a real competitive edge I had over other new grad hires, the fact that I'm not a total asshole. I think its really good for morale and job opportunities. 

I got a new MacBook Pro, I have my own desk, there's free food and drinks, and a great location In downtown Oakland, and I walked to work which takes about 30 minutes, really, I am not sure what else I should be asking for. I mean I'm waiting to get my paycheck, so I can use it on some things, but honestly, I really don't think I should be asking for anything else. 

Just trying to figure out when I want to transition into doing something for the world. I think it's really good that I have an adult person job making actual money, and I think that I deserve to be in a relaxed atmosphere, especially after how shitty UCSB was to me. So for those reasons, I'm going to be focusing on myself, but I still have a deep-seated obligation, I feel like because I'm so privileged, that I need to help those who are not. I'm not really sure with that like to look like, and I want to spend a little bit more time figuring out how to make myself happy and how to live my life, I think that figuring out how to be happy should be maybe 80% personal work, and 20% helping others, Or maybe closer to 50-50. Honestly, I think I should be helping others way more that I am helping myself, I think it's okay to be still little selfish at this point. I mean selfish in the sense that I am spending my own money, and buying things for myself, but I do want to be frugal and not throw money away or anything like that. 

I'm liking Pandora lot, although I have only been there week, I wouldn't be surprised if I spent five years there. And maybe that would be good place for me to spend a lot of time, Save my money, maybe move around and Live in different places, and then actually start do something professional to help others. I think a lot about tech, and what kind of jobs are out there, and what people are doing who are in my area. It seems like it's all very selfish, or mostly technologies to help people who are already privileged. And I heard a quote recently, that said the future is already here it's just not evenly distributed yet. I think that's what I really want to do with my life; personally I feel like I have everything I need, and I can make do with much less. It's nice to buy new things because I can, but I also understand that my needing a slightly larger television, is probably a much less important then somebody being able to eat and sleep on a regular basis. 

 feel that I shouldn’t really feel obligated to help other people just because but the same sense I feel like humanity is about helping other people.  Why aren’t we using all of the resources that we have as a first world country just to help Third World countries. I think we should only really be spending our money to help those who need it and on trying to stop fucking up the environment. I think that's what I really want to do with the rest of my life, I want that to be my legacy, not that I care much about being remembered, but I think I'm back want that to be my life work. I guess I just want to help people in a way that I feel that I can, and maybe that will be doing something technical or managerial in terms of getting the technologies we have here to places that need it. But for now, seeing as I'm only 22 years old, I think it's okay for me to figure out what I want to do now with my money.

I saw Isabel and Mike and Kim Sinclair yesterday. And Paul. Was pretty much the same. Everyone was. Isabel really is one of my best friends.

Well I went to the city today met up with Sidney and with Madison. Good to see them, I guess I still feel strange around Sydney, it seems like she is still has feelings for me.  This is pretty much what I expected, I was mostly surprised with so normal we were together. I mean, I spent most the day with her walking around the city, exploring. I guess now that I've had some more time to think about it, maybe about two weeks, I guess it just comes down to that I don't love her. And I don't think that's a really big deal and I think that she's kind of come to realize that as well. She wants to talk more about it though, which I'm really not averse to doing, I guess the main issue I've been having lately is sexual frustration. It's hard to go being in a relatively healthy relationship to not being in want it all, especially when you're in serious as I am. I guess I feel less bad about it now.  mostly I am working on trying to figure out what things I find it important what kind of person I want to be.</string>

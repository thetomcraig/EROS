	<string>Deep into summer.
I can’t believe its been only two weeks since I graduated.  I’ve been getting lots of steps (sans fitbit), and have been working on several projects, reading a lot, running, and getting a tan (yeah that’s right).

I do feel a bit of that listlessness that often causes me stress, but I have found that I’ve been doing a really good job of dealing with it.  Not as much stress as I have been having, and it feels like I have been out of school for at least a month or so - I can’t believe it’s only been week. 

I have found that web development is really tedious, but I have been trying to tech myself som web stuff to be a bit more prepared for Pandora, and also because I want to us it in some of my own projects.  Also working on a new Minecraft server that is coming along well.  Reading two books as well.  Haven’t been doing that much Japanese practice, but I want to start as soon as I finish the Minecraft server.  

The daily mediation is what its all about.  I have been doing this on my own - no place near Eagle Rock, and I am happy that I have been sticking with it because while I feel pretty well adjusted now, I know it will be beneficial for probably the rest of my life.

Planning on going to Oakland soon, and looking into housing, which is pretty exciting.

I am also going to finish my piece of writing soon about my college experience.  This is something I have been thinking about - I worry about making it too whiny, but I suppose I will have to wait and see how it goes - lots of editing will necessary.  Anyway, not a lot of stuff to say really, just working on the stuff I want to work on, that’s about it.

Very very grateful for this free time.</string>

	<string>At the beach for the weekend.  Going to have a garage sale tomorrow so we can get rid of some shit before moving.  In like a month...  It's kind of a big deal, which is I guess why I've been trying not to think about it.  I mean someone has to be for it because everyone else seems to have reservations.  I don't know, who am I to say Im any better, of course I don't want to move.  But its not really at all related to me, especially because I will be back in school.  Which I don't want to go to, but there is not much I can do about that.  Although I did want to look into the whole transferring thing again.  Maybe I can transfer for the spring semester, I don't know.

Really, Ive come to realize that I hate school and I just need to be done with it.  Not that this is a good thing to say.  I want more than anything to like school, to enjoy it.  And I do really like somethings; my friends and some teachers, Sidney…  But I hate academia and I always will.  That's why I am so happy that I like my JPL job, and it is a job.  Its not a blowoff sumer job like the Hollywood Bowl.  And sure actual jobs I have will be more intense than this JPL one, but I feel like I can handle it.  Because I really like computer science, and this is making me appreciate that, as apposed to school, which only frustrates me.  But hey, only two more years!  Two more years….

I just finished Sputnik Sweetheart.  Blew my mind at the end.  I thought it was great a lot of stuff about loneliness and duality and other tropes.  One of those books that really makes you think.  I really like books like that.  And I really like books.  I think I might sell the Nexus and Buy a kindle instead for to read books more betters.  But I digress.  Well kind of.  I am going to try to make my heath a priority.  For next year that is.  Because if I care more about getting exercise and sleeping well, maybe I will actually do those things.  Exercise and sleep, those are the big ones.  And my eyes, because I don't want them to be killed by staring at screens for my entire life.  Which I probably will do.  Anyway I have to sleep, more to come...</string>

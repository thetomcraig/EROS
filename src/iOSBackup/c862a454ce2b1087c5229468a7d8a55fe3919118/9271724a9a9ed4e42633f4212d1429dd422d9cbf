	<string>I am actually quite happy right now.  I guess this is not the best thing to say, as it implies that I am not happy most of the time.  But I think thats actually true, not that I have depression issues - or maybe I do, regardless, I really am not happy while I'm in school, and its about all I have done so far… 

Anyway, I am happy because I actually like my job, and I have time to do some stuff, like projects.  I am not feeling guilty, like I am working on borrowed time, and I really don't have all the free time I would want, but it is so much better than school.

I go to work, and work there, and when I come home, I don have to do work anymore.  It's that simple.  And why shouldn't it be?  At school my work just follows me - everywhere.  I honestly just hate school, and I'm sure saying I hate it makes it worse somehow, but I really do.  I hate school because it's constantly there and frustrating and I don't ever feel that I am doing quite what I want or getting exactly what I want out of the experience.  But whatever, that's beside the point.  The point is that I hate school, and for once, I really like what I am doing right now.  It is so much easier to be present when I don't hate what I am doing presently.    

I am so excited that I am liking what I am doing because I had almost given up on being happy.  As depressing as that sounds, its not too far from the truth.  I have been holding on for a long time to this feeling that somehow what I am doing will make me happier in the long run.  This job has really showed me that.  And not because it is some stupid summer job that's almost like a diversion.  That's what Caltech was like, and the Bowl also to a certain extent.  No, this is a real, 9-5 job, or 8-5 really, and I am actually working hard and applying the knowledge I have gained over the years.  And this is certainly not me praising my school or my educational experiences because all of that really has been frustrating to say the least.  

No, this is me really realizing what I want to do.  While this JPL job is not really what I want to do for the rest of my life; I would not be upset if my first real job was like this one.  I am actually interested in the work I am doing, and that is a first for me.  

I am having a good summer all around, and this is really looking like a good summer for me.  I am working and making a lot of money (half of which I have already received) and I am working on projects and finding time to exercise.  Yes, this type of schedule is definitely what I have been after.  

I am working at work on a program that converts PNG and JPEG files to a NASA standard format.  And it may be a bit boring, but I actually like it.  Especially because I can listen to music all day.  

I am working on making the n64 computer into a more reliable gaming system, in a wood box with more power, and I am also working on translating a classic text game into python, which if nothing else, keeps up my programming chops.  

Oh yeah, and I didn't get into Vanderbilt, what a fucking waste of time that turned out to me.  Which is really frustrating for me, and I wish I had had the option to leave SB at least.  On the bright side I get to see my friends again and UCSB is a devil I know…  And there will be some exciting things coming up.  

In a pretty good mental state right now.  Thinking about Sidney though…  You can guess the rest.  

OH YEAH.  And mom and dad are going to move to NYC at the end of the summer because my dad got a job teaching at NYU.  So, like, holy shit.  And stuff.  

I am grateful more a lot of things right now :)</string>

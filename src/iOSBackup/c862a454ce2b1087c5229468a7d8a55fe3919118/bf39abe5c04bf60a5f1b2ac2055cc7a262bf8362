	<string>Things going ok.  

Was very worried about the s170 project and became less so today when we fixed a bug.  Honestly though cs170 is stressing me out so much it’s crazy.  I like that I am continuing to see Jeremy, my therapist here.  And I do, sometimes…, fee l confident about my academic.  Its just so hard and I feel like I am going to fail cs170 all the time.  I have gotten tunnel vision for this quarter because of that class and I have tunnel vision because I just want to get my degree and get out of here.  Which is really sad, because I would like to enjoy my final year here.  Maybe ifI was a different person I could do that, but I’m not.  I mean, I’m trying really hard, but honestly I don’t know what else I can do.  I am not depressed, well…  It’s hard to say really.  I am still constantly stressed so I do not know what to do about that other that the meditation and a few other things of that nature. 

My conversations went well today.  I didn’t really forget to keep up and I found it challenging to hold my tongue.  Overall, 3/5</string>

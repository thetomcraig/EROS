	<string>Better - getting there.
I’m less lonely!  I have been spending more time with the new grads at work and we have a pretty solid group of friends which is great - and I am really liking work.  I am learning more at work and noticing some things that I think can be improved so I’m hoping I can spearhead some of those things.  Still working on the girl thing - I have two (!) dates this weekend which is pretty exciting.  Things are copacetic with Sidney too.  I worry that she still wants us to be more than friends, but I still think I made the right decision in breaking it off when I did.  I do really like spending time with her and I think that with a little more time things will be good between us.  

It is still kind of frustrating at work - the amount of code and logic and terms that we deal with is daunting, but I know that I have to be patient.  That’s just not the kind of thing I am very good at being patient with.  It makes me feel inefficient, like I am wasting everyone’s time.  But I think that this is the kind of thing I have to get used to.  Indeed, feeling like people don’t like me is something that I have had to deal with for a long time.  And I will probably have to deal with this for the rest of my life.  Which is ok.  I have been thinking about this kind of thing lately.  Meditation and exercise do a lot in this respect.  At least at getting the anxiety out of my head.  The only question is what comes in to fill the void.  By getting rid of some of the stress I have had for a long time, I feel more empty.  I want to fill this space with people.  I want to have stronger relationships I guess this is also the kind of thing that takes time.

The good thing is that I am so glad to be out of college.  I am grateful every day that I am not longer in school and I am actually being an adult.  The bad thing is that  still wish I had had a nice college experience.  But at the end of the day - the important thing I think is focusing on the present.</string>

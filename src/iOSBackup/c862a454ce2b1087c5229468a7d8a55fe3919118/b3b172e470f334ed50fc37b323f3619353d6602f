	<string>Rylan and Kassia. 
Rylan and Kassia came over today.  Jack had to go to work.  I anticipated having them leave when he did, but this didn't really happen.  We watched Hot Rod and hung out etc.  And we just came back from RED 2.  

I don't know why I keep getting unsettled.  It's almost like I can't even hang out with my friends.  I mean I just keep asking myself why I feel uncomfortable and making the problem worse.

I think its uncertainty.  I think I am most bothered by not knowing what my plans are.  But it's so many other things to.  

It's perfectionism.

I want everything to be perfect.  I want to have a perfect run, a perfect girlfriend, a perfect day, a perfect computer, a perfect room, a perfect experience.  I just get so bothered by every little thing.  And lately I have been bothered by the fact that all of this bothers me.  It's a vicious cycle.  But when I get depressed because of this, I want to hold onto that feeling for some reason.

I want to sink into that depression, and I get some kind of pleasure from the feeling. 

I think the fact that it is so hard for me to be content gives me some pleasure, like I am some how better than those who need less to be happy.  I am caught in between this desire to be content with less and the desire to stay the same, and figure out the exact combination of things in my life to make me happy as is.

Maybe this is unattainable.  I mean, of course it is - it's perfection.  I know because when I do balance everything absolutely perfectly, I get bothered by the fact that it takes so much to be happy.  So it must be unattainable.  But I can't just decide one day that things don't bother me.

Take computer science projects for example.  I decided recently - I talked about it in here - that I would start doing more things daily, so better achieve my goals.    Working on a current computer science project was the main activity.  And this is great, because it really keeps me up on what I am working on and makes it easier to come back to it every day and get things done.  

But the problem is that I look at this from the outside and it seems insane.  Not that one activity, but this is how I live my life.  I try to make absolutely everything in my life perfect and anything I can't make perfect I try to eliminate from my life.  I try to have the fewest number of physical things because I am not 100% satisfied with any of them.  

I guess it's just that the necessity to put in so much work frustrates me.  

I am thinking about going back to see Mark Baker...</string>

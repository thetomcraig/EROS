	<string>JPL building. 
Talked to a woman today about going abroad.  I have a few reservations about it.  It will cost about 5000 more dollars than a quarter to do the Japan program, and I don't know what the work load will be like, but it will be a lab plus 4-5 classes.  I'm going to ask my advisors about the classes, but I think I need to really figure out what I am going to do with money.  

I appreciate that my parents are going to pay for my entire tuition, and not give me student debt.  Because of this, I don't think it would be fair to make them pay more money - especially if it meant I would be working at JPL making some of my own money.

That's the other thing - if I do this abroad program I wont' be able to work at JPL next summer.  I cannot say for certain that this will be an option, but I do know that I won't be able to make any money.  And I would like to make another 6000 dollars.

JPL is pretty good.  I am getting kind of bored of it, but it almost over so I suppose that is just as well.

Rylan and Alfred came over after my work today.  Seeing them was nice, and I even got to wrk a bit on my projects today.  Projects are both pretty good.  If I haven't mentioned before, one is an app for managing music and learning about new releases, and the other puts iTunes information in the notification center on the mac.  I think both will happen, the latter before the former.

Still though I am kind of bummed.  I think relating to my perfectionism issues.  I am glad I going to meet with Mark Baker soon.  I have some stuff to figure out...

Concerning the perfectionism, I still can't fucking decide what kind of tablet I want.  The kindle is nice, but won't be able to handle some PDFs I throw at it for sure.  The nexus is fine, but has hardware issues that bug me.  The new nexus is supposed to be awesome, but well see on that front.  It is kind of nice to have a lot of money though.  I think I am going to buy a new monitor soon.

More musings on myself later, I am fucking tired.  Going to see Isabel tomorrow and my birthday the dat after.  Not to excited about the latter though… Hm…

I am grateful fro my friends - Alfred and Rylan.

	<string>So close I can taste it.
Home this weekend, for memorial day.  Today it has been a year since that kid shot up Isla Vista and killed 6 people.  Its weird how time tends to drag sometimes, and just such by in other respects - I can’t believe that was a year ago.  One thing that has not seemed to much by though is my time in college.  Which is slowly drawing to a close.  You know, I didn’t love it.  I didn’t really like it at all.  I learned so much and had such great experiences, but this was constantly overshadowed by  negative experiences.  I have decided that I want to write a small story/piece about my college experience, because I think I will have a few interesting things to say.  I am think it will be cathartic for me.

I have a few assignments left, and seeing as i can get a D- in my classes and still graduate, I am not to concerned.  It sill be a lot of work though, thats for sure.  

Stress has been okay, and I can tell that mediation and mindfulness are helping me a great deal. 

I am telling myself now that it really doesn’t matter much any more because I am about to leave and start my actual life.

Not much more to say - I am unimaginably excited to graduate.  This is mixed with negative emotions as well, but I just can’t wait.

I just can’t wait

	<string>Break is good, almost over. Played minecraft with bros, watched movies and TV, worked on project, dicked around on the Internet. 

I want to go back, I miss Sidney and some friends. But I just know it's going to be as stressful as it was last quarter, it always is! And I can't be price I got a B in math and English! Oh well. Still no Cs so that's ok. I can wait until march when I hear back from colleges. That's a long ways away...

Project going well learning about NLP and regular expressions stuff. It's very interesting. 

Caught up on almost all my TV.  Tried the mini series based on the Stand. It was terrible :(

Book is good, waiting to read a paperback, and I can't believe some fucking guy in Zambia bought my nexus on eBay. No way in hell I'm sending in there, that's bullshit! People on eBay can be shitty. I guess people in general can be shitty. 

Going to try to see Isabel before i go back. And watch a but more TV. But I'm pretty ready to go. 

Going in to JPL tomorrow I think. Not that I know what for. </string>

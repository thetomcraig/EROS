	<string>Did some homework after I got back yesterday, and ate with friends. I did a bit more work after and watched a movie with Sidney in my room. 

I was not planning to, but we made out. She was wearing a dress (because she came from Mother's Day brunch) [probably the second time I have ever seen her in a dress]. Needless to say it almost came off, we got pretty into it. 

But she again had to stop; and obviously felt like this was too much. I had to level with her, and said that we could not keep doing this. She keeps telling me that she doesn't want to go farther (physically) and I can tell she really does. She told me not to touch her breasts last night, then I tried a second time and pulled her dress almost all the way off.  I told her that it was not healthy for us to continue this cycle, not to mention that it causes me anxiety. I asked her about sex, and she said she doesn't feel any different about it. Sex is just "not something she wants to do" but I still find it strange that someone my age would have such a strong aversion to sex. Regardless, we have very different opinions that can seemingly not be reconciled. I said last night that we had to do something, and I think we do. But the only options are really, break up or have me be content with less, which I am not sure I can do.  

I've been thinking about it. In light of my possible departure next year, I think we should part ways at the end of the year. I really like her so much, I don't want to let her go, but I would be much better with doing so at the end of the year and not this instant. </string>

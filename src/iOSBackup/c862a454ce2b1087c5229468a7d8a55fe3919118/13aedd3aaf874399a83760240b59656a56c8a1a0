	<string>Its late, I can't sleep. My eyes hurt from reading a lot and not using my glasses. The Stand has gotten pretty good, my only issue with it is that its about 1000 pages long. I've got a million things running through my mind, Adrian, Sidney, UCSB and transferring, robotics club, sickness and projects....

I wonder if I'm being to harsh wanting to cast Adrian aside as a friend. I mean, am i just trying to be a perfectionist in trying to not be his friend anymore? And how the fuck do i intend on doing that anyway? I royally fucked it up with nick Wong, but that was different... Right?  I mean the problem with him was that I was his best friend and he wasn't mine. I worry that maybe I'm uncomfortable being close to people. Dune was the same way, I showed my true colors when he ruffled my feathers. But that was different too, dune is an asshole, he cheated on Isabel, and I gave him a second chance didn't I? Yes I did. I have no regrets by dune, at least not many. But I still get the feeling that I don't like being close to people. Happened with dune and with nick Wong and now Adrian. I worry still that I told Katya I loved her and it wasn't genuine. But aren't most of these people flawed more than I?  Dune is undoubtedly and asshole, Katya was immature, NickWong couldn't take no for an answer and Adrian is a prime asshole.

 I don't know though, who am I to say I'm better? But I am aren't I? I try to be a nice guy which a lot of people do not. But are you what you pretend to be? I like to think so, but I really don't know sometimes. I have always worried that deep down I'm an asshole, lately I've realized that deep down I'm a cynic. Those two are close aren't they? 

Part of this worry is how tired I get of people? I only realized it in college but I'm very much an introvert. If I don't get a healthy dose of time alone into crazy. And I mean alone, not this alone together bullshit people are so find of going on about. I mean alone, in all but complete silence. Something that college does not understand. And I venture to say America does not either. What with the constant need to be with some one doing something together. Our society is all to social if you ask me. 

I started to get tired of Sid towards the end of last quarter, I spent way to much time with her. I suppose it would have been perfect if she were my girlfriend, but fate head other plans. We were together for a short time (as together as two people can be when they only hold hands and nobody knows about it). I'll always wonder what it would have been like if he had been a bit more ready - ready to actually be in a a relationship. But I don't begrudge her anything. She gave it a shot and wasn't ready, it was mature of both of us to call it off and I respect her for doing so. I mean yeah it sucked, and still does, but it was the right thing to do. And it isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I still want her sometimes, hell a lot of times, but it was the right thing to do. 

What has t changed is that she is still my best friend at SB, and I suspect I'm her's. I can't help but think how stupid it was that it didn't work out between us, we really were good together and we're so much alike. But oh well, that's the way it goes I suppose. What really sucks about it is that I'm pretty sure I don't have time for a girlfriend. I can work well with Sid and she's a out the only person ever who I've been able to do that with. Who knows what next quarter holds though? Too bad Isabel doesn't go to my school, heh. But seriously I'd like a woman like her, she's got her had on straight, that's for sure. 

Back to Adrian. Yes it's right to cut it off. But I e learned that I don't have to cut it off completely. I can manage him in small doses - very small ones. I think I'll start by telling him I don't want to be partners in 56. And see if I can be in a group without him in 48. 48 will be harder to swing I have no fear about 56 as it seems to be a regular ol' cs class. With 48 though it might take some trickery to get in a group without him. I hope to god he's not in my lab. If he isn't it will all be fine and dandy. If he is I might be stuck with him. If that we didn't have 48 this quarter... But spring quarter is back to one cs class, so I think but that quarter I da shake him, at least as a cs partner. It's too bad because we do work well together, but man he gets on my nerves. And I feel perfectly warranted wanting to distance myself from him especially with the shit he pulled last year. It may have been almost a year ago, but his attitude has not changed much. If anything he is more of an asshole. I give him the benefit of the doubt most of the time, and I'm about done with it.

I feel a lot like Larry Underwood from The Stand. He is plagued by the feeling that he "ain't no nice guy" even though he comes off as one. In his last he did some shitty things and can't get past that part of himself, as if he has the weight of the world on his shoulders. I feel a lot like this character. I feel like I'm a nice guy and I know I am, but at the same time I know other things about myself. I dislike a lot of things. I look down on a lot of things. I know I'm not any better than most people, but at the same time I know I am. I blame my family to making me such a cubic, but I know that part of it just me, me, me, me. What really peeves me is that I get pissed off sometimes when people do things that I do myself. I know that literally I am no better than the person who does the action but it doesn't matter, I hate them anyway. I hate people who chew with their mouth open or don't push in their chair or leave their shaved hairs on the sink or don't flush the toilet or who have bad grammar or waste their time playing video games or who are conceded. I don't hate all these people but I definitely am filled with disdain.

And this is why I need to be alone for so long. Without it I start to pick and pester a d correct grammar and give shit. With no alone time I worry I might be overcome with disdain. This is why my time needs to be managed carefully. 

More to write but I'll try to sleep. Still coughing from pneumonia but mostly better. What a boring break. </string>

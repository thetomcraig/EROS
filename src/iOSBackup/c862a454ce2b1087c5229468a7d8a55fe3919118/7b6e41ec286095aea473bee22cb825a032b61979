	<string>JPL - pensive. 
I have up on writing I here every day. 
I decided I wanted to use my time for more important things to me, reading, running, comp sci. 

Work is okay. I'm pretty burned out on it so its good that its about to end. 

May have finally found a good backpack. Other stuff is fine, though I still am looking forward to seeing mark baker. 

Jack is leaving in a few days, too bad I didn't get to hang out with him after my job ended...

I stayed up late tonight to watch TV with the family , going to be tired in the morning, but I feel like it's worth it.  

To my future self: you are better than your peers. Maybe not at SB, and maybe not always. But as far as JPL is concerned, you're better than them. You give a shit. Work hard and are motivated. 

I am proud of myself for having drive. There are things I want to accomplish and I want to feel like I have worked hard.  I am grateful for my work ethic. </string>

I saw Mark Baker (therapist) today.  He had a few things to say about me.  He mentioned the difference between usefulness and value.  Usefulness being show good/productive you are and value being more emotional; how much you are loved.  

I need to appreciate myself for simply existing - or so he says...  Which is hard for me; how can I love myself devoid of the things I like about myself: my work ethic, intelligence, kindness, etc.  But he says this has to with my thinking that's too logical, and not emotional enough.

He basically said that I have trouble being bothered by so many things because I try to quantify everything.  I don't really concern myself with my emotions, and instead I am always thinking that allocating more time to things can make me more happy.  

I am not happy because I pick a thing to tell myself is making me unhappy, and fixate on that.  There is an obsessive tendency here, I can't stop thinking about  the things that bother me and t really gets on my nerves when things are not perfect.  Perhaps from anxiety; fearing that I am not perfect myself.  

He said I should start by trying to ask myself why I am bothered  by something when I find myself bothered by it.  And I am not really attuned to my emotions, which is why I ascribe such strong emotions to things of little importance, because I can't stop thinking about them.  

On that front.  I got a backpack I think I like.  It's the fifth one I think...  So there is a good example - why am I so concerned with getting a new backpack, and why am I so concerned with hang perfect physical possessions?  I don't really know.  I seem to have convinced myself that there is a line though.  I know that, it's just drawing the line that's hard.

Does one annoying zipper on a backpack mean I should keep looking for a new one?  Does one aspect of a girlfriend mean I should dump her?  I don't know... I mean that's what I think about with Sidney - I want to be in a relationship that has a physical aspect, and I don't know if I can be with Sidney when I go back to school, if that's not an aspect.  But I don't know how she will feel either... 

When it comes to physical objects.  I don't really know - maybe I just think that imperfections will get in the way of me enjoying the object.  And then I will feel like I wasted money.  Or maybe I think that I will be made unhappy by imperfect things - but maybe this is a bit of a vicious cycle...  I'll have to think more about that.

I am tired, must slep. 

I am grateful for myself.  Despite my flaws, I think I am a good person.  </string>

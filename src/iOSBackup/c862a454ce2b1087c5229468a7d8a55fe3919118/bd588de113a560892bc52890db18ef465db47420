Well I have been home for about a week. 

Just been working on my projects and such. Been playing the new Pokemon with jack which is pretty fun. 

I've been a little ticked off at him, but really it's the same old shit. I think I'm upset about living here because I miss our old house. 

I really do miss it. A lot. Today I went for a run around here and it was pretty terrible, I have yet to find a good place to do that...

Found out yesterday that I got a C+ in my convo sci class. The class I slaved away for. And today I learned that I got a D+ in physics 3. Because that's what my school is like.  

I know myself. I am not a C or B student. And this is why I tried to transfer colleges. I killed myself in com sci class this quarter and my remaining time was devoted to physics. I got an A in writing, and will probably get a B in philosophy, the classes that I don't even really give a shit about. 

My professors are assholes, idiots, or some combination therein. This quarter was particularly bad. And for anyone reading this later, or even to myself: I am NOT whining. I am one of the most studious people I know and this is simply not a representation of my work ethic. I should count myself lucky, honestly, for getting all A's and B's until now, and I suppose it could be worse, because I don't car that much about my GPA and am not going to grad school. 

BUT that doesn't make me feel any better about this shitty situation. It's just so frustrating. I will probably write about it a bit more when I've thought about it a bit longer. </string>

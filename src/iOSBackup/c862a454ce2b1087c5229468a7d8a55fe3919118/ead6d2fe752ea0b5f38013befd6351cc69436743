	<string>I never write in here as often as I want to, but that’s okay.  I;m almost done with my stupid summer class, and have a few weeks left at JPL as well.  I am less stressed right now that I ever am in school, but there is still stuff to bother me, like always.

I’ve been doing some thinking recently about my own wellbeing.  I picked up a book I read in high school - “The Happiness Hypothesis” and in the book the author talks about happiness and different conceptions and mechanisms that people have and use.

Some people are simply more pessimistic than others, and he talks about how you can deal with that.  The fact of the matter is that I am the kind of person who is stressed about everything, and not a whole lot can be done by me just trying to force myself to have a different personality.  He talks about three things: meditation, cognitive therapy, and drugs.  The drugs thing has been on my mind recently.  

I already mediate every day, and in the past week I’ve started doing this two times a day, and longer.  I’m not great and it, but I’m working on it, and I have been enforcing my own kind of cognitive therapy, which is sensually writing in this journal.  This I guess I should be doing more.  I take that back, its not that I really need to be writing in here more, because like meditation, I can write in here a lot but it won’t be any good if I am not doing it in earnest; doing it for the intend purpose.  Which is to think about myself and my emotional response and state of wellbeing.  So I don’t really need to write in here all the time, but I need to pay attention to how I am feeling more often, because this is what’s actually important.  This journal is just an easier way to do that, that I can look back on for specifics.  

Really, what I did last school year that helped me with some of this stuff was pay attention to myself.  I need to do more of that - more paying attention and being aware.  And I suppose this is the point of meditation as well - being aware that is.  And the cool thing is that I can link this up with lucid dreaming if I want.  But I think I need to just try harder to be aware.

Okay, so I’ve got that down, and it sounds great right?  Well yes, it does.  Only problem being that I have felt that way for the better part of the last two years.   Knowing I need to change some things, and doing some of that change, but the problem is that its so hard.  Not that it should be really easy.  Because if it were really easy then I wouldn’t really feel like it was meaningful.  

But.  It is notable that this is so hard for me.  Like impossibly hard at times.  And this is one of the things the author of this book talks about - the concept of the cortical lottery.  People who are not as stressed as I am may not be happier, but if they are naturally more optimistic, it makes sense for them to extol the virtues of looking on the bright side and trying harder to be positive.  Because this is easy for them.  The problem here is that I have grown so accustomed to thinking that the anxiety I feel is shard by everyone.  To a certain extent it is.  But in the way I may think.  Everyone is stressed at one point or another, and lots of people have the anxiety issues I have.  But the fact of the matter is that not everyone is stressed all the time like I am.  And I really mean stressed all. the. time.  Like, by everything.  I’m spelling this out so it serves as some sort of information for a future version of me, should I change in this respect.  Tests give me anxiety, work gives me anxiety, so does being people, watching TV, being by myself sometimes, having free time.  Yeah, having free time make me nervous because I do not know if I am using it the right way.  That’s why I think this is a problem.  Because I am grown accustomed to a  constant level of stress in my life that just constantly runs in the background, and is only exacerbated when I am in really stressful situations.  

I am not and probably never will be the kind of person who just does;t give a shit.  With the work I am putting in now, an maybe some more work I can move in that direction.  But its very tiring and hard to do this kind of thing.  Mental health is this invisible thing that makes is so hard to quantify or qualify, and so hard to treat compared to any other kind of health issues.  This is why I have been thinking about drugs.  The author of this book I was looking through took Prozac for a time, it’s a SSRI, and he said that it amazingly made him feel like a different person in the respect I am talking about.  He stopped because  on side effect was a partial loss of memory.  I have also been thinking about marijuana and have heard that is has been rescrubbed for generated anxiety disorder (which is the closest to giving myself a disorder I can get).  

I am resistant to drugs for various reasons, monetary, reliance, reputation, and other things.  But the more I have been thinking about it, the more I have come to believe that maybe some drug or something of that sort that could make it a bit easier for me to achieve the mental state I want using the tactics I’ve already described, could be worthwhile.   Maybe…

So that’s what I’ve been thinking about lately.  

I am grateful for my friends and for everyone I come in contact with.</string>

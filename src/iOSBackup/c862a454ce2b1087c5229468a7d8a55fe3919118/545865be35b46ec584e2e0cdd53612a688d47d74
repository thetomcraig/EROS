	<string>Thanksgiving shit.
Same old same old from thanksgiving, but in a new house. I think the Pandora interview went well, technical interview with several members of the team. I also spoke on the phone yesterday with someone at Evernote who have me a coding assignment to work on. It's interesting because I've done in person interviews as well as I've the phone interviews, and having something to work on in my leisure is a nice change of pace. 

I am sick and my computer is still broken - found to need a new motherboard. So I'll be using my custom built computer in the wooden box when I go back to school. 

So I'm still not feeling too hot, kind of depressed. Just like nothing is worth anything. I just can't stop having those nihilistic thoughts about how everything is pointless. Not sure ghillie to get past that right now. And being such just really make me give less of a shit. I feel somewhat uncomfortable south my family and I'm not quite sure why that is. I think some of our had to do with jack and what I was talking to Jeremy about at school. A lot of my anxiety comes from family stuff I think.</string>

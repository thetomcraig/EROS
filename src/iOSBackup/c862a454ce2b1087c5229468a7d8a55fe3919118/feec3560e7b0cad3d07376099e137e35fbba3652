	<string>Past week was alright. I decided to not add the CCS course I crashed because it was really not at all like what I thought it would be. People working on a project that seemed interesting but not me being able to work on my personal project. I caught up on philosophy reading, I'll be keeping that class and did homework, I finally feel on track. 

I really like the mouse I got, I think it's the one. 

Was going to have a robots meeting but it got delayed again - I've decided not to go to the actual convention. I'm willing to help program this weekend, but the convention will take time and money I don't have. Plus I'm tired of working with disorganized people. 

Speaking of which - sales engineering. We planned last weekend to do spring insight today. I asked grant three says ago what our plan was and he said he didn't know. Two days ago I sent a message to our group asking what our plan was saying we had to be at the SRB at 8:45 to setup. I said if we were going to switch off, I'd like to do a later shift so I could have breakfast. Adam responded and said he couldn't do it and grant asked if I could go early and setup. I thought he was speaking to Adam and also because I was frustrated and it was 10:30 pm, I did not respond. In the morning grant texted me and asked if I wanted to switch off, I was sleeping. I responded by saying I wasn't there and had said I would go later! Too with he responded "Dude." I thought he might say more and didn't know what to do so I said nothing. Then at dinner I texts grant back and he seemed kind of angry. But I said sorry and that it was a misunderstanding and he agreed. So I believe we are in the same page right now. Adam and Adrian were MIA.

Last night Sidney spent the night. We watched Austin powers and wanted to hang out with our friends but they left again with out telling us - starting to get on my nerves. Anyway I recently had a talk with her and we decided that if things were to plateau at what happened last week it would be ok. Meaning her taking off her shirt and what that implies. Meaning she still is not ready for sex. I think I honestly will be ok with second base and maybe she will want to have sex eventually. If not, it may not be the end of the world. Having said that she said she wanted to take it a bit slowly and I agreed. So we made out last night and I tried to not get carried away but I ended up feeling her up anyway and she was ok with it; just wanted to keep her shirt on (for now at least). Same happens in the morning. 

Did homework today and did some errands. Hung out with Adam for a bit and watched to last austin powers with Nate. Feels like Sunday but its not yet, another day to get ahead on my work! Worked a bit on my project going to make some progress to show to the CCS people so they can hopefully let me in. 

Frustrated with robots and sales engineering, at least the former is almost over. Not so many office hours this quarter - should be a bit more relaxing. 

Not that bad a day, or week. </string>

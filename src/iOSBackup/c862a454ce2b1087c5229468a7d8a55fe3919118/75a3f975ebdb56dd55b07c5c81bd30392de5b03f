	<string>Well I haven’t been my best.

I recently gave my computer to Apple and was without it for a few days, and I thought that would be good for me - clearing my mind, doing some other things I wanted to do.  It wasn’t really, I was really depressed and had a breakdown lsat Saturday.  I haven’t been feeling much better recently either.  I’ve continued to see Mark but I’ve been depressed and the main thing going on with me right now is feeling bad about feeling bad.  That is, being tired of who I am and disliking feeling the way I do.  I talked to Mark about seeing a psychiatrist and he gave me some names but I was not able to get in touch with any of them.

I know that one of the reasons I feel so shitty is because I don’t want to go back to school.  And, despite our best efforts, Sidney and I will be living in Manzanita again this coming year which we didn’t really want to do.

But there is more going on; some other stuff that I am dealing with that is making me depressed.  I’ve come to realize lately that I do a really good job distracting myself from the anxiety and emotions I feel a lot of the time.  I use school, personal projects, or whatever, as a way of filling the void.  Because I am very uncomfortable with myself and not having anything to do.  Really, I am terrible at doing nothing.  Because I feel like I should always be moving and getting something done or else I am worthless.  This is one of the things that Mark thinks can be solved by me working on my personal relationships and being more in tune with my emotions.  Which makes a lot of sense and sounds nice, but the problem is that I really suck at doing that.

Trying to make time for people and pay attention to the way I feel and actual feel emotions as opposed to analyzing and worrying.  This is all stuff I suck at.  And I suck so hard at it that trying to fix the problem makes it worse.  Trying to make time for people and spend more time on emotional endeavors doesn’t make me feel better.  It makes me feel worse because the whole time I feel like I should be doing something, so it is no more helpful than doing nothing.  I am so far in the hole - so convinced that I should be active all the time doing stuff that I can’t d nothing.  I can’t relax.  Relaxing for me is only really done after I have DONE a bunch of stuff.  I don’t feel like I deserve to relax if I haven’t been doing anything.  That’s one of the reasons why I find it so hard to write in the journal also.  I think it’s helpful but it’s never really that helpful.  I feel like I should be writing in here but never like I have time to.  When I finally do, my feelings afterward are more relieved that anything else.  I don’t feel great, or energized or anything.  I feel more like I put things in order and will have a slightly easier time doing stuff soon.

Running too isn’t as relaxing as it could be.  I really like doing it and it does make me feel better, but I always think about stuff while doing it.  It’s not like I can clear my head.  Clearing my head is really hard.  Meditating hasn’t helped me do this either and I am pretty bad at that also.  

None of this is to say that I am a bad person, but that I am to good at these things.  I think I tend to contain a lot of my emotions.  I don’t really get angry at all - outwardly that is.  Any containing all of this leads to sadness/depression.  Especially when I don’t have any outlet and don’t allow myself to relieve any stress when I do get an outlet.  

Mark suggested I try Yoga.  Chances are it will drive me crazy, but that is kind of the point.  Yoga is all about clearing your mind and doing literally nothing.  Which I am really bad at and I think need to learn to do, so I am thinking about trying this out this coming school year.  

I am annoyed that I didn’t get to talk to a psychiatrist.  Because I really feel like I need to make a serious change this year.  And I wanted to try that.  I am going to see if I can do something at school though.  This quarter is going to be tough.  No doubt about it.  And I don’t want to be buried.  Even though I know that to a certain extent I am going to be.  

One other thing I can try is what I did in high school.  Then I was just as obsessed about being perfect and doing well in school as I am now, and I always gave myself Friday afternoon off.  I never did homework on Fridays.  I ended up doing homework both days of the weekend but I took off Friday to stay sane.  I might try this or something like it.  I think I need to schedule myself some time in which I WILL NOT do any homework and see how that works.  Maybe the time I have between classes or something like that.  

The fact of the matter is that I write a lot in here about what I can do to feel better and not all of it helps.  I think  I do a little to much thinking about what I should be DOING and how to budget time and how much of this I should do and ho much of that I should do.  Because if I can make myself feel better in terms of overall wellbeing (I think) everything else will follow.  If I can feel better in my self-esteem and stress then I won’t worry about how much video game I play as opposed to book I read as opposed to running I do.  Of course planning and making lists will always be the kind of person I am.  But planning more and more is not going to help.  I need to stop planning my time and work load and start worrying about my holistic well being.  Fixing this is orthogonal to the amount of stuff I do.

This is what I have been talking to Mark about.  There are two things going on at once: the amount of stuff I do and things I accomplish, and how I feel about myself.  I talked to him last year about this also: usefulness vs. value.  Usefulness meaning what I accomplish, and value meaning how I feel (I think).  I am very weighted on the usefulness front, I keep thinking that doing more and more will make me feel better.  But this is because I don’t have much weight on value, I don’t think that spending time with people and have important relationships will make me feel better, when it really should.  My firm believe that it won’t make me feel better actually makes it so: I get stressed when I spend time with people, and when I don’t feel stressed I end up feeling like I was somehow cheated, like I should have gotten more out of the experience than I really did.

More on this later.  Going to think some.

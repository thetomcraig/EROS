Interesting that the quarter is almost over and I feel like its barely begun.  I feel like I am not nearly as busy right now as I should be…  But really, I am doing everything I can in terms of work.  It’s just that frustrating situation of knowing there is work do but being unable to work on it.  So I’m sure I’ll be busier in the coming weeks.  I will probably feel like a giant stretch of work until the end of the quarter, but hey, what can I do about it now anyway?

So I’ve been using the time I have to work on my project, and that’s good.  I am grateful for that time.

Going to hang out with Adrian in a few minutes, its interesting to me that I rarely hang out with anyone now, without Sidney.  Is that normal?  I don’t know; sometimes I worry that I spend too much time with her.  But I don’t know, I really like her so I don’t really think its BAD.  But sometimes it does feel kind of constricting…  

I really like her though.  And I am glad I can have in her in my life like I do.

Finished the JPL paperwork so thats defiantly what I’m doing this summer.  Meanwhile fighting for another class I need to graduate in time.  God it’s hard to be in this school.  But I maintain the current view I have on the matter - if I can make myself happy here, I can be happy anywhere (or at least that’s what I think).  But I miss home.  Like, South Pasadena home.

But I do think I have been doing a good job this year making myself happy, and I know I can keep that up.

I am grateful for this happiness.</string>

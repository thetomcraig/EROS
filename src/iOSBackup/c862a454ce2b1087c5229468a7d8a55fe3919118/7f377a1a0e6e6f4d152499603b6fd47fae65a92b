So now the warted really is almost over.  Like every quarter though, I’m ready for it to be over.  It’s not that this quarter was necessarily good or bad, it kind of just happened.  I wasn’t really as busy as I though I was going to be this quarter, I’m only taking three classes - 2 CS classes and an ECE - and I expected that to be a really busy schedule.  Its nice though, I’ve been making some money at work and I have actually had some time this quarter for some projects and things.  Like I had a bit of time to breathe.  I can’t assume I’ll have a quarter like this again though.  :(  

Probably going to take two summer courses online if I can, just to get them out of the way and get the units I need.  

I am realizing I need to write in her more often, it’s one of the things I did last quarter that helped me less anxious all the time. 

The other thing I did was think more positively.  It sounds dumb, but focusing more on what I have made me more happy overall.

In that vein, I am grateful that this quarter has been a little bit relaxing.  Maybe not relaxing, but at least a bit better than previous quarters.

I wish my schedule could be a bit more structured, but this quarter has had some very hectic moments and some actual free time.  I am getting a bit better at no feeing guilty when I have free time and actually taking advantage of it. It’s hard for me to do things for myself because I always have some work that I could be doing and I feel bad for not doing it.  

But I am getting better at telling myself that have some free time is as important as doing work.

Anyway I am glad to have some time to write in here.</string>

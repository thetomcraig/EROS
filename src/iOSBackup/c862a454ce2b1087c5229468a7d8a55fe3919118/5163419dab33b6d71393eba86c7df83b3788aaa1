	<string>Week 2 - Spring quarter.
Well, seems like I’m about settled in the spring quarter, already much to do.  I know I am going to be busier than last quarter, but I think I can manage it.  It’s tough though, because it seems like I am not going to have time to complete all the work I have to do, but I always do…

I do have the new programming job, and unfortunately it is taking the place of my person projects.  By which I mean I find time for it where I can and work here and there.  Time will tell i I will have time for my projects, but I have been doing a good job of taking advantage of free time when I have it, and understanding that it won’t always be friday or saturday night.  I’m glad Sidney and I got into the english class we were crashing - it provides a good break from math and engineering work.  

Not much else really, just keeping up with meditation and trying to be more present, and appreciating the good things in life.  Sidney and I have even found time lately to watch TV - something I found impossible freshmen year.  So that’s al well and good, this first week will be pretty packed, lets hope it gets esker as the quarter progresses - like THAT ever happens. 

Oh yeah, also the ResNet job is going well.  Getting into more interesting things with that as well.  More on this soon.</string>

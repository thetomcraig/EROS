	<string>Mediocre week.  Work, work, work.  Today was pretty good though, I ran had a good talk with SIdney.  I had been having some concerns and I think were on the same page.  Mot of it was related to "girlfriend" and "boyfriend" and we think about these words differently.  Honestly we think about these things differently, but I'm glad we had a talk because I think it helped with some concerns I had with the relationship.  She views friendship and relationship as separate processes, I view the relationship as consuming the friendship.  

Watched escape from New York with Sidney.  Then she spent the night.  I had a really good time with both, and I'm glad she finally decided to stay over.  Not ideal for al the time, but I enjoyed it.  We made out a lot.  I almost felt her up, but she said she wasn't ready for that.  I suspect she will be eventually, and I might be able to one day have sex with her.  We shall see.  I bet she didn't think she would ever make out with me, or sleep in my bed, so I think she might.  But I also know she is  getting used to the kissing etc.

I got see Jack Sinclair last night.  He was in IV staying with friends for a night.  Didn't really do much but wandered around IV with him, Sidney, and some of his friends.  It was good to see him, and being buzzed, he was actually a lot more open.  Too bad he wouldn't be around tonight, or I could take him to the party at Kevin's house.</string>

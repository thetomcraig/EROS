	<string>Yesterday I saw Isabel, went to downtown LA with her.  Went to a  bookstore, and ate Japanese food, and bought macaroons.  I came back to hangout with Alfred and Jack, we played some minecraft and went to see "This is the End" which was pretty good.  Today I have made myself breakfast and I am soon to go to Caltech for orientation, different from the JPL orientation apparently.  I still feel off, I don't know why I am just not really enjoying being alone I guess, which does make any sense because I like to be alone.  I'm not really sure what's going on with me, I guess I am just acclimating.  I want to start working I guess.</string>

	<string>My desk at JPL.  Not the best desk setup, but I suppose it could be worse.

Working in the Pi, I want it to be a mine craft server, but it's being difficult.  As usual.

So I heard today that we are no moving to New York.  I don't know why I say "we" because I wouldn't be going.  I also agree with the reasons for not going.  But it still bothers me, and I can't quite place why.

I think I am bummed because I couldn't transfer schools.  This NYC thing made it seem to me like things were changing, progress was being made.  But now, they ail be mooing down to the Laguna house.  Which I do think is the right choice, because it would be very hectic to move to NYC not to mention the expenses.  But it seems boring, stagnant.  It's just so… Unexciting I guess.

But it's not as if I feel like: "New York is so cool and different, why can't we do that?!"  Which of course is part of it.  But i think what really bothers me is that it makes me feel like change can't be made.  

I feel trying to happy for me is a bit of an uphill battle.  When I am happy about where I am in life, and things are going well, I feel like I can always find something wrong.  I feel like I should be generally happy and have things bother me every now and then.  But this has never been the case; attaining happiness is generally temporary and difficult.  I guess I'll have to think about this…

I tend to get into a vicious cycle - not having enough time to do certain things, then making the time and then running out of time for everything else.  I really just don't know - well I don't know a lot of things I guess.

Maybe this all has to do with the success ≠ happiness thing.  I mean, I tend to get depressed when I don't get anything done.  Maybe I should be content with just working on the things I work on.  I worked on the Pi today and it was problematic, but should the working on it in general be the important part.  Maybe…  But thats so fucking hard.

I am grateful for my job and my family.  I am grateful that I have become less worried about what people think of me when it comes to my job.</string>

	<string>Yesterday I met with my computer science group.  Micael and Tyralyn are doing some good work and we hashed out a story line together.  Houjie showed up and he's doing some stuff, Chang Sun never even responded to a text.  Getting pretty fed up with her and this working in a group is pretty difficult.

Regardless my end of the  project is coming along. Working with graphics is pretty fun.  Still haven't put everything together but we will soon, got a to done on the story line.  Wrote paper this weekend also.  I wrote 721 words in 1.5 hours which is pretty amazing, never done homework so fast.

Last night I went to Carrillio part with Josh, Adam, and Sidney.  Beer was had.  Brought up some things with Sidney that were bugging me, and I kind of made a big deal out of it.  I just don't know how to be with PDA, and I've come to believe she doesn't really care, so I'll ease into it I suppose.  Regardless the night ended with us on my bed and I kissed her - a lot.  She's not ready for "something more" and I'm ok with that, I think I can live with it.  I really like her and I really like the place sea re in now.  She almost slept over last night, I would have liked her to, but it was very late and she said it was too late for her to do so, which I believe.  Regardless I was thrown for a loop, but whatever.  She said she would be ok with that another time, s perhaps the coming weekend - something to look forward to?  I think so.  Anyway, she makes me really happy and thats all that matters, right?  	

Looking forward to the JPL job this summer, soon I'll find out what exactly I'll be doing, and hopefully I can find some time to do some FORTRAN stuff on my own.  

I've come to realize something this quarter - I cannot get by doing all the work  as it has become literally impossible.  I have already stopped reading all the history and I'm going to have to devote more time to what's important.  I never though "time management" would mean, "decide what to bullshit" but sadly, thats whats happening. But at the same time, I'm excited.  If I can learn to bullshit, maybe I can finally have time to do more things - probably not, but I may be less stressed if I become ok with giving some things less than my all.  Maybe I'll be able to rad finally!  Going to do my CCS application soon, after I talk to Conrad tomorrow.  I'm excited about that, it might be better for me, but my pass time is coming up, so I have to decide what classes to talk, because the requirements are different for CCS majors.  A lot to think about.  to to mention I have to get the school to send my forms to colleges I applied to for transfer.  Which should be a bitch, BUT it will be the last of that!  So far the quarter has been haphazard, and thats how ILl remember it, but hey, Ive got a girlfriend, right?  

SEC is kind of a problem, the freshmen reps should not have a lot of power.  The least of my worries, but still its one of them.

Should be done with CCS/SURF/Transfer processes soon and that should be a load off.  Programming night for the robots club is coming up, looking forward to that, it should be a lot of fun and something great to put on a resume.  My resume will look pretty damn god by next year.  CalTech, JPL, robots club, SEC, and the Comp Sci project

Anyway I've written a lot and I have to go bed.  Eating with Dalin in the morning, I miss that guy.  

I think Sidney is thinking of us more as an "us" which I really like.  I don't think she think of me as her "boyfriend" but that's okay, because I know she likes me, and she has gotten better at taking initiative and such.

Basically stressed as always, but something should be resolved soon, and other more stressful soon.  SUCH IS LIFE.</string>

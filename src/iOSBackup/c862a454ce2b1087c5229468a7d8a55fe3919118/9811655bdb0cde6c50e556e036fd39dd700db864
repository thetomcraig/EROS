	<string>More confused again.
Things have been pretty good - work is pretty much the same and other things have been ok.  Tomorrow I am going to finally merge my code which will be a pretty big change, so that’s pretty exciting.  Other than that I’ve been working on Japanese and other things/projects.  

I’m pretty fed up with the online dating thing.  It’s made me pretty jaded, and I am not even getting much out of it.  So I’m on the verge of giving up on that whole thing at least for the time being.

I have been thinking about Sidney also - just trying to figure out how I feel about her.

I think that breaking up with her when I did was definitely the best choice, and I needed to do at the time.  What I am trying to figure out right now is whether I still have feelings for her, and what that means if I do.  

Lately I have been missing her, but I have been trying to figure out if it was her who I was missing, or if I just missed being in a relationship.  I assumed that really I just missed being in a relationship.  I assumed that if I did get back together with her, nothing would change and I would feel the same as I did when I broke up with her.  I still am afraid of that really, but what I’m trying to figure out now is how much of that stuff has/can be fixed if I feel like I really want to get back together with her.  Of course its also depended upon how SHE feels.  I feel like she still has some feelings, but I don’t really know, and for all I know she isn’t interested and this problem will be solved for me.

My biggest fear is that I tell her I still have feelings and she does too and we get back together, and then I end up feeling the same way I did towards the end of senior year; tired of her and fed up with seeing her every day and ready to spend time away from her.  I would kill me and be so unfair to her if that happened again, and I am terrified that it will.  I felt like she really loved me and i just didn’t love her anymore.  I don’t really know if that was because of a fundamental issue with the relationship or if I was feeling that way because of other circumstances and feelings.  I just don’t know.  And I don’t know if the solution to being unsure is action or inaction.

I have been feeling for the past week that I want to talk to her, but the real issue has been what I want to say.  I feel that regardless of how I feel or what I want, she does deserve an actual explanation for why I broke up with her.  What she does or how she feels about it notwithstanding, I just feel that overall she would benefit from me feeling her the truth about what was going on.

I don’t really blame myself for NOT telling her the truth at the time either.  I didn’t really understand how I felt or how to explain it at the time and I think I really did need to be away from her and out of the relationship to gain the (relative) clarity I have now about the whole situation.

I don’t know about the whole thing really, I see reasons for both notions and just don’t know what to do.  I know that I will tell her about how I was feeling before, but past that I’m kind of lost.  I see it like this:


Being back in a relationship with Sidney - benefits:
Being in a relationship is nice (companionship, sexy time, etc)
I know we are social compatible

Being back in a relationship with Sidney - pitfalls:
Stress level - managing her stress like in college
Maybe I would get tired of her?
Maybe I won’t love her?

…Well, that was useless.  I guess I’ll just tell her the first thing and see what happens.

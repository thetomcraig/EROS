	<string>This schedule is interesting to say the least.  I get up early and do shit for a solid 5 hours every day then I'm done.  It's the kind of schedule I've wanted and I do like it a lot more than spread out classes not being able to get things done.  Unfortunately I feel exhausted at the end of classes but hopefully I'll acclimate.

Gave up on dinner it's shit, breakfast and lunch every day and hopefully don't get hungry.  Realized that today I'm going to do a bunch of reading this quarter.  Have more to do tonight, and it's getting late.  SPent a lot of time just figuring out what I need to do this week and next.  Letters of rec for JPL and transferring, organizing schedule and personal life etc.  It's looking like this will actually be an alright quarter, academically.  I'll be working hard no doubt, so we'll see how stressed I get :/.  Forgot the robot club existed, meeting about that tomorrow and SEC meeting is this weekend, lot of shit to do.  Really want to finish up the GOLD script, and I'm getting close, but man, school just always gets in the way.  No doubt, I still hate school.  

Did manage to avoid the shit out of Adrian, because he did the same to me, looks like we'll just be acquaintances, which is just what I wanted, so at least that worked out.  Going to talk to CS56 teacher tomorrow about how much fucking reading we have to do and I should have letters of rec done by the end of next week - HOPEFULLY.  Can't wait to be done with all these letters and shit.  Honestly I can't wait to be done with this school, I really hope I get into Brown, really Rice or Vanderbilt would be really cool too.  Even if it's not everything I want, transferring will be good - I'm getting tired of tho place, and being frustrated with teachers.  

Got into CS48 groups today with Tyralyn, her friend Michael, and some strangers.  Looks like we're going to do a project in Python, which is cool, I think it will be good to say I'm really good at one language, while knowing other ones too.  I'd love to be proficient in Python.  n64 is being a good little server, but GOLD script is being a dbag.  Gotta go read more shit.  I'm pretty good at shit-eating, I'd say it's what I'm best at.</string>

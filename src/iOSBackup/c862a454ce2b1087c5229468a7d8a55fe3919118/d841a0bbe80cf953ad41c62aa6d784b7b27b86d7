	<string>What a fucking week.  I've come to really dislike thees 4 day weeks.  I have to do the same amount of shit, but have one fewer day to do it all.  I did finish my JPL SURF application this week which was good, but it was pretty god damned stressful, all told.  I stayed until 3:45AM Wednesday night, and had an 8AM Thursday morning, doing computer science.  Had to finish that today, just in time.  Really, its a group of three, doing work that should be handled by 5 people.  Had a math midterm to study for and only had two days to do so, took the test today, don't think I did so hot on it.  Got back a paper in English with a B-, and I do not think I was that shitty.  I talked to the TA who said it just didn't follow the prompt very well, and wasn't that bad, all told.  I do not think a class should be design such that the students are expected to do poorly on a paper, the class average was a B-!  And the math too, was shitty because the test sucked and the teacher, and CLAS teacher both suck.  

This quarter remind me of winter quarter last year, I'm not really doing so well, and it's because my classes suck ass, not because I'm not trying hard.  I still am, but I have to put with shitty teachers and poorly designed classes.  This is the kind of shit that makes me want to transfer!

I have to talk to the registrar soon and get Conrad to send my last letters of recommendation then I'll be done with this stupid paperwork!  

I'm sick of this quarter, and this school to a certain extent.  I'm tired of being incredibly stressed and not getting sleep and doing poorly despite my efforts.  I'm tired of shitty teachers and poorly designed curriculums.  I'm tired of this shittiness being accepted as par, such that we call some teacher "good" when he simply doesn't have an accent.  I'm tired of having my time wasted and not being able to do anything aside from maybe read a bit of a book in my free time.  

I just want to have options, I hope I get accepted to some colleges so I can at least have a chance of escaping this destructive state.  It's such that when I do have free time, I'm too tired to do anything with it, or I feel guilty, like I should be doing something with the time.  I'm really tired of this shit.  I don't even have enough energy to be angry with it, I'm really just dejected.  At least I'm over halfway through this year.  I don't like the idea of having an unenjoyable college experience, but it looks like at least half of it will be like that.  

I dream of going to a college in which I do enjoyable things, and have a great time.  Who knows?  Maybe this is possible, or maybe it will be the same, or worse.  I honestly do not know, so it really is pointless to think about now.  My life is pretty day-to-day right now.  

I may look into counseling services.  They may just be able to help me, who knows?</string>

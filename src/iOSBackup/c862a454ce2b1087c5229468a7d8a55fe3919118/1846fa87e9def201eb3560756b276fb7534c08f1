	<string>Less Confused.

For starters I told my female coworker friend that I had feelings for her - and they were not reciprocated.  But I’m cool with it.  To be honest I was not sure if I really was interested anyway, so it’s not a big deal.  I think I am a little desperate to be honest, and she is a pretty cool person.  So nothing has really changed in the romantic world - still using dating apps and don’t have much going on.  Like I mentioned, I am pretty tired of things like Tinder, but I am still using some apps now and then - what the fuck else am I going to do?

Also I got high for the first time recently, which was a really cool.  Crystal, Sidney, and another friend I met recently all went to Delores Park in search of “The Truffle Guy” who had truffles with weed in them.  Turns out he was not hard to find and they were good truffles!  It was kind of a weird experience but I think we all had a good time.  Crystal staid at my place for a nice and we cooked together which was also fun.

Just got back from going home for Thanksgiving, which was also pretty enjoyable.  It’s really cool, I think, to spend time with your family as an adult.  When you have original things to say and you feel like an individual.

Overall I am happy.  I am still really liking work - which is changing a lot, people leaving etc, and I like the friends I have kept and the friends I have been making.  Aside from not having a girlfriend, everything is great!  Bu seriously, I have a lot to be grateful for, and I am very grateful.</string>

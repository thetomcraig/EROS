	<string>Got a good amount of work done today, and watched two movies. Productively, pretty good day. Halfway done with my paper and I should know how to finish it up now. Looks like dead week will actually be pretty laid back, I don't have any other homework for the rest of the quarter and I shouldn't be too stressed. All relative, I know. I got a late call from Adrian, who was drunk and lost. I offered (reluctantly) to pick him up but he never told me where he was. I believe he eventually made it home and he put brad, his housemate, on the phone. It was hard for me to tell if brad actually was on the phone but I'm pretty sure he was. He went on the same old story about how he was sad that we didn't hang out anymore and I only wanted to spend time together to do work. The only problem with that is that it's true. I can only take so much of Adrian now, I kind of wish he was a secondary friend, who I did work with and didn't really hang out with. To be brutally honest, I don't really like him very much. Which is part of why I didn't want to pick him up. Is that so wrong? I don't think so really. If we were in comp sci together I'm sure we would have drifted apart long ago. I wish this was t the case but it is and I'm not going to for e myself to feel a certain way. But I was willing to pick him up and that's wha matters. I believe you are what you do. But I suppose you can do what you are... I guess I really don't know. But I try to be a nice guy and its gotten be this far. 

Sidney has had a cough for the last couple days. I've actually been feeling disdain towards her whenever she's coughed. I think I'm getting tired of her constant presence in my life. I suppose it's back to being kind o a loner. At least until I meet a girl I can spend time with and do homework with! But I don't know when the fuck that will be. It feels like I have to learn to be content with myself again. Which I can do. But meh. </string>

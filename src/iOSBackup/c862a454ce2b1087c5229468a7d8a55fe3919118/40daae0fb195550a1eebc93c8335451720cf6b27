	<string>So, things are okay.

Sidney just came to visit this past weekend, and we celebrated the 4th of July with friends.  So that was good.  Still stressed about all the same shit I’m stressed about.  

I have this compulsion to finish my app this summer.  Like, I really need to finish.  I know I shouldn’t feel this way, but I will defiantly feel like a failure if I don’t finish it this summer.  I think I’ve made this deal with myself that I will promise to take it easier and set smaller goals for myself as long as I finish PlayMe this summer.  But really I don’t think thats an unrealistic goal.

I’m just frustrated at how long computer science takes.  I’ve been thinking a lot about mu possible career path and becoming more nervous about it.  I don’t really want to do something I don’t want to do all day that is frustrating and come home to do something else that is frustrating.  The problem is I am not really allowing myself to relax.  I really do enjoy computer science but it is also an incredibly trusting thing to do sometimes and it’s all I want to do sometimes as well.  

Sometimes I wish I could change, and be someone who is satisfied just watching TV all day.  The fact of the matter is that I will never be this person.  I think I can become batter at actually allowing myself to relax sometimes, but I also don’t think I will ever be satisfied by being this kind of person.  The thing with computer science is learning to become satisfied with working on the thing, not with the actual output, because sometimes this can be zero.

Back to career stuff, I am worried about this.  I think working at a startup and doing what I love all day would be my dream job.  I suppose this is possible, but it is hard and probably not something I be able to do right away.  Unfortunately I think the thing to do would be work for someone else in CS for a time before trying to start my own business or anything like that.  I really want to do the Japan thing as well.

Maybe it would be a good idea to go teach english in Japan and just work on projects in my other time.  So  wouldn’t feel overwhelmed.  Then maybe transition to another kind of job over there.  I really do want to go there though.  

I’ll have to think about it more.

Anyway the JPL job is okay, but kind of boring.  Doesn’t hurt to have money in the bank though.  

I want to work on being able to relax.  Maybe when I am done with this stupid online class that will be easier.  Maybe.

Either way I’m glad I got to see Sidney and my friends this weekend, and taught Lola had to play fetch.  </string>

	<string>Up and down.
Things continue to be up and down.  I’m working really hard with school and its often really hard to see any result from my efforts.  I have a giant comp sic project that still isn’t working and is due tonight, and I feel behind in all my other classes.  When I have a work load like this I just feel like one big thing in a class puts me behind in all three other classes I’m taking.  It makes me feel really depressed like I did last year all the time.  This year I have been mostly doing really well being happier.  Maybe not managing my strew but just being aware and being happier overall.

I am really stressed today because of the comp sic project and everything else that has been put aside because of it, and because of Sidney.  Lately we have been really good and I can tell we are both feeling really good about the relationship.  We went to a party together last night and came back to fool around.  But I really have never been able to get her off.  Obviously its easier for her to get me there, ad I have been able to make her feel good before, but I have never made her come.  This is a real problem for us.  And its why we haven’t had vaginal sex, even though I eel like were ready to.  We stayed up really late last night and in the end we both felt kind of shitty.  Because she felt like it was her fault and I felt like it was mine.  To be perfectly honest it is mostly her fault, but she has no idea what she likes and why she can’t get off, and I feel partially responsible because I literally don’t know what to do with her body.

I guess there are new things to try, I’m not too sure though; I just don’t really know what to do…  The good thing is that communication is really good, about all aspects of the relationship.  I think we maybe need to try different things.</string>

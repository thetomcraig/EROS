	<string>I had about a ten second conversation with the girls who live across from me today. I've been here 10 weeks and I don't even know their names. And it's on the god damned door. So much for being mindful. I'm going to actually go over and talk to them when I can. I think I make a pretty good impression. One of them is kind of cute. Funny how easy it was to get over Sidney. But man I think I deserve someone nice. So I guess for now I'll hold out. 

I e started the do a little every day technique again. I basically read the news, read a book, write in this journal, and work on a current project. I think that's enough, but it will get harder come finals and such. I think I'm up for it though. </string>

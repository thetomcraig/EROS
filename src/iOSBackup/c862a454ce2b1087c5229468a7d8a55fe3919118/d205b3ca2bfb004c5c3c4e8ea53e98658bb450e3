	<string>Closing in on 3/4ths.
Well this year is almost over.  I am really excited for summer and have a lot things I want to do.  And the really great thing is that I know I already have 2 A’s and a good grade in english.  So really I am only worried about one class.  That class is a nightmare, but I shouldn’t dil (well, hopefully).  

 I can’t believe I am just about done with this year.  I really can’t believe that I only have one year left.  It’s crazy.  

I am bummed that I haven’t accomplished as much as I thought I would, in terms of myself and my sanity.  Of course, this concern is nothing new.  And in one respect I feel like I have accomplished a lot.  The last couple of years I have been really stressed and hated it here.  This was the first year that I started to figure some stuff out and be less bummed out all the time.  It will be interesting to see how I feel this summer, because I really enjoyed last summer and I feel like this one will be similar — Ill be doing the same internship and stuff (for lots of dollars).  

But the money isn’t the point, and neither is what I be doing (well, kinda).  Really what matters is how I feel about myself and everything.  And this year, for fall and winter quarter, I really felt good about myself and what I was doing.  I mean, I still wasn’t having a blast doing all the work I had to do, but I felt good overall.  It was really this spring quarter that I fell off the wagon,  and started feeling shitty again.  I think I did a decent job of recovering, but It’s just so hard, and this quarter, academically, was incredibly difficult. 

I really do know that I will be happier after I graduate.  That is not to say that I need to resign myself to being depressed for the next year, but I know that I will not have to try as hard to be happy when I graduate.  Well that’s what I think at least.  There are just so many frustrating things I have to deal with in school that do not exist outside of it.  

I need to focus on what is important and really try to limit my stress otherwise.  I mean, that’s really fucking hard.  But I have to try.  And thats what I have been trying and it has been helping.  I just have to keep it up.  

Now, to finals studying.  

I am grateful for my family and for the new house I am looking forward to living in.</string>

	<string>Week four, almost halfway done with this quarter, still feel like it has barely begun. I keep doing a lot of work and not having things done, keep worrying about the comp sci project, getting it done on time, we should be ok eventually though. Math test coming up, worried about that shit big time. The quarters are some fast, and yet I always look back at the beginning at it seems so far away. At the beginning of this quarter I had classes that ended at 2pm everyday and it was great. Except it wasn't. Now things are rearranged but I'm still it getting enough rest. Going o office hours really takes it out of you. Not to me took how hard it is to even get to some office hours. I'm finally done with that. Got all the letters of rec for JPL. Going to work there this summer. Trying to learn some fortran first though. Still no time fr side projects, or exercise time, or reading time, or robots club time, but that should be ok actually not so worried. 

I bet I use the word worry uncountable times in here. The thing that isn't worry some is Sidney. We've been together since the 21st I believe and things are going pretty well. Easing into PDA in from of our friends and most of them know about us. She was awkward with kissing and now she seems okay and good with it. Of course I'd like more, but I think this will suffice. She makes me really happy and she's said the same of me. I really like her and I'm happy with the way things are. If like very much to have sex with her, but doubt that will happen. But hey, who knows?

As far as the school, I'm still pretty frustrated here, especially math. I don't know what to think about that anymore, but I'll be doing my ccs application this weekend. </string>
